            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Afflicted Clergy.</head>
            <div n="1" type="section">
               <p>I Now proceed to examine another of the Pamphlets, by which theſe of the Epiſcopal Clergy, who hate, and malign the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, do load them with reproaches, and aggravate their own ſufferings, beyond all the bounds of Modeſty and Truth: Its Title is, <hi>The Caſe of the preſent afflicted Clergy in</hi> Scotland <hi>truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</hi> Thus we are Treated by Men of a reſtleſs Temper, who are imbittered in their Spirits, by what inconveniency they are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into, from the Eaſe, and Dominion over their Brethren, that they lately had. One Book after another we are Laſhed with: If they would ſpeak Truth, and exerciſe Reaſon, rather than expreſs Rage and Fury, we would bear it; and clear our ſelves in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all impartial Men. But we muſt be content to take things as they are, and defend the truth, and our ſelves, from theſe aſſaults that they think fit to make, of whatever ſort they be. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to the Book it ſelf, I ſhall a little conſider the Preface. He commendeth the Moderation, and Integrity of the Author, and indeed it was needful: For none living could gather either of theſe two good qualities from this Pamphlet. He telleth us of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of that Book, <hi>To procure pity from the moſt Charitable Church of</hi> England; a begging deſign as I marked on the other Pamphlet. <hi>That Men may conſider the Fatal Conſequences of Papal Supremacy in a Protestant Kirk.</hi> If he would have his words underſtood, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33452:2"/> be ſhould ſhew us wherein ſuch a Supremacy is exerciſed; But railing doth beſt in general Terms. It is alſo, <hi>That the Church of</hi> England <hi>ſhould bethink themſelves how to quench the Flames, leſt it destroy themſelves.</hi> Thus they ſow Diſcord among Brethren, and animate <hi>England</hi> to concern themſelves in the Affairs of our Church, when we do not meddle in their matters. He will have all <hi>Scots Presbyterians to be Perſecutors,</hi> and chargeth them with <hi>thinking that they do God good ſervice when they kill Biſhops.</hi> Which Facts, that he aimeth at, the Generality of Presbyterians did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, as much as he can do. This is an early teſt of the Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Integrity that we are to expect from this piece. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proveth our Perſecution, by citing ſome paſſages out of B. <hi>Burnet.</hi> Whom being a party, we are not to admit as a witneſs againſt us. Yet we acknowledge in his Citations, the truth of ſome rigour that was uſed in theſe times of Broils and Contentions; which Presbyterians do not Generally allow. If we would recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, we could leſſen theſe exceſſes almoſt to nothing, by nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the Barbarity uſed in <hi>Scotland</hi> by his party againſt us: But I rather wiſh that both may ſtudy Sobriety and Moderation, than defend, or practiſe over again what hath been amiſs. I commend what followeth: His attempting to <hi>narrow the differences that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Presbyterians and Epiſcopal Men in</hi> Scotland. In Doctrine we are profeſſedly one, but really there is a party among them who dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us, eſpecially about the <hi>Arminian points:</hi> In Worſhip, the difference is very ſmall: Only (contrary to his deſign) he widen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, when he falſly ſaith, that ſome in time of Prayer uncover their heads but by halves. Was ever this approved by Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians? What he imputeth to us of fulſome Expreſſions, and vain Repetitions, is a Calumny; if there be ſome on our ſide, there are more on his, who through ignorance, or unſeriouſneſs may be charged with this. It is alſo falſe, that <hi>at Baptiſm, we bind the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the ſolemn League and Covenant:</hi> May be ſome might do it in a time when we had no Government, but it is thought fit among us to make the Word of God the ſtandard of what we believe, and bind our ſelves to practiſe.</p>

               <p>§ 2. He eſſayeth to make a parallel alſo betwixt our and their Diſcipline; but in that he is not ſo happy. For tho' we deny not that they have ſomething that looketh like Parochial Diſcipline: And alſo the name of Presbyteries; yet they have but a ſhadow of both: For not only all that power that any of their pretended Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories exerciſe is derived from the Biſhop: But the exerciſe of it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33452:2"/> dependeth on him, and he can ſuperſede it when he pleaſeth: Which if any of them ſhould deny, I can prove by two Inſtances in one Presbytery: <hi>Viz.</hi> That of <hi>Chirnſide.</hi> One for habitual Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the Sabbath day, being cited before the Seſſion, and for diſobedience to them being cited before the Presbytery, while they were managing the proceſs, a prohibition was procured from the Biſhop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which ſtopt the proceſs, and the Man Drank on, in defiance of both Presbytery and Seſſion. Another accuſed for living with a Woman as his Wife, to whom he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Married, and being proceſſed by the ſame ſteps as the former; by a prohibition from the ſame Biſhop the Presbytery deſiſted; and the parties continued in their former courſe of Life: And yet this Prefacer hath the Forehead to ſay, that their Diſcipline is the ſame with that of <hi>Geneva;</hi> and I believe his party will give him little thanks for the condeſcentions he hath here made, as we diſlike them, becauſe not true, nor ingenuous. But we know the deſign of ſuch pretended moderation; it is to load the Presbyterians with the guilt of cauſleſs Schiſm, as appeareth in the ſequel of his Diſcourſe: But when they debate with us about the difference betwixt a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter and Biſhop, they ſpeak in another ſtrain. It is alſo falſe, that <hi>they have Elders who are no Miniſters,</hi> theſe among them who are more ingenuous will not allow them that name; much leſs do they give them the Power of Ruling Elders, or own in them the ſame Authoritative, and deciſive Power as the Miniſters have: I know no other deſign in keeping up Seſſions, and Presbyteries in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but that the people, who have ſince the Reformation been uſed to Presbyterian Government, and can comply willingly to no other Church way, may be deceived with the ſhadow of it, when the thing is cunningly taken away. He ſaith <hi>that in Synods all things are carried by plurality of Votes.</hi> It is ſo indeed when the Biſhop pleaſeth; but dare they Vote any thing, or can any thing be carried by their Authority, without his Lordſhips conſent? I think none of them will affirm this. He confeſſeth the Biſhop hath the power of Ordination in him; tho' he uſeth to take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Brethren of the Presbytery along with him (that this is always to be done he affirmeth; but I am ſure it is not the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Epiſcopal Men:) All this conſidered, let any judge, whether he ſpeaketh truth when he ſaith, that the Biſhop is but a conſtant Moderator. A Moderator hath no Power more than the leaſt of the Meeting hath; only he ordereth the meeting, that all may not ſpeak at once: propoſeth Matters to them, pronounceth, as their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33452:3"/> Mouth, what is the Mind of the Meeting: But nothing is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by his Authority; nor are the Judicatories of the Church his Council, as Epiſcopal Aſſemblies are to the Biſhop. We do then maintain, that there is ſuch a difference between them and us, as may juſtifie our not owning of the Biſhops Authority, nor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Meetings that is derived from it, and dependeth on it. We never uſed ſuch an Argument to juſtifie Rebellions: It was not the exerciſing Epiſcopal power that cauſed what he ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; but their forcing the Conſciences of Men, and Barbarous Perſecutions, whereby people were put to the utmoſt extremities. If the Conſciences of his party could plead not guilty, of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Butcheries that have happened, as well as the Sober Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians can, who had no intereſt in them, but to Lament them, and the occaſions of them, it were well for them. If Barbarities be committed now againſt them, we defend them not, nor are they chargeable on the Presbyterians; but on ſome few whom their Perſecution hath enraged. He telleth us of more Hiſtories of the Clergies Sufferings to come out. Our Work is to Examine theſe that now he is pleaſed to offer. If he prove by his Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of paſſages, all that in his Preface he propoſeth to make out by them, we ſhall ſuccumb in the Debate: But I am ſure ſome of them cannot be proved, other things cannot infer the Conſequents that he draweth from them: But I will not anticipate. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his Preface is a renewing of his begging Addreſs to the <hi>Church of England:</hi> What they get that way we do not envy: We wiſh indeed the Change of Epiſcopacy (though we will take no unwarrantable courſe to effect even that) but not the Ruine of Epiſcopal Men.</p>

               <p>§ 3. The Book it ſelf is odly methodized. We have two leaves called the firſt Collection of Papers. Next a Letter, under the Title of the whole Book: Then the firſt Collection of Papers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun again: And ſo to the ſecond, third, and fourth Collections: But we muſt follow whither he thinketh fit to lead. I muſt here refer the Reader to what I have ſaid in Anſwer to the firſt Book, and the ſecond Letter. Sect. 6. Where it is made appear that the Presbyterians are not accountable for the diſorders that are ſaid to have been acted; Tho all the Stories that are told were true. But becauſe in this Pamphlet we have Atteſtations added to the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that are brought, which is not done in the other, ſomewhat muſt be obſerved concerning that. Which is, that moſtly they are <hi>teste meipſo,</hi> the Complainant is the witneſs, which is not fair.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:33452:3"/> And often one of theſe Miniſters witneſſes for another, and he doth him the like kindneſs, for requital: Which derogateth much from the Credibility of ſuch Teſtimonies. Further, all of his Witneſſes are the ſworn Enemies of Presbyterians, and in a Combination to defame them: And we have from the Pamphlets now under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration a taſte of the veracity of the Men whom we have to do with. If his Witneſſes make no more Conſcience of ſpeaking truth, than the Author, or Authors of theſe Pamphlets do; few thinking Men will be moved with what they ſay. I come now to conſider his particular Stories. He beginneth with the Miniſter of <hi>Cumnock,</hi> with whom he joineth the Miniſter of <hi>Auchinleck: Whom ninety Armed Men forced into the Church-yard, diſcharged them to Preach, and tore their Gowns: And declared, that this they did, not as Stateſmen, nor as Churchmen; but by Violence, and in a Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way of Reformation. Anſ.</hi> It is Atteſted under the hands of <hi>George Logan</hi> of <hi>Logan, William Crawfurd</hi> of <hi>Dalegles, John Camphel</hi> of <hi>Horſecleugh, George Camphel</hi> of <hi>Glaisknock, John Beg</hi> of <hi>Dornal, John Mitchel</hi> of <hi>Whetſtonburn;</hi> all of the two Pariſhes mentioned: That they who did this were not of either of theſe Pariſhes, nor was it known who they were: Only that they were <hi>Cameronians,</hi> who had ſuffered ſeverely; and were now gathered together on occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an Alarum that then was in the Countrey: Nor had any in theſe Pariſhes any Acceſſion to that practice. And it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that many of theſe Miniſters entred by a Military Force, as they were ſo put out: particularly the Miniſter of <hi>Auchinleck</hi> had his Edict ſerved with three Troops of Dragoons: And that People never ſubmitted to theſe Mens Miniſtry, but by the force that was put on them by Armed Men: And they ſuffered very hard things; and yet the people of theſe Pariſhes bore it patiently. In the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Machlin</hi> he groſly belyeth them: They uſed no violence to the Miniſters Wife; only gravely reproved her for Curſing and Swearing, which ſhe uſed. He paſſeth <hi>page</hi> 4. to the Presbytery of <hi>Dumbartoun,</hi> where firſt he telleth us, What <hi>Mr.</hi> Walter Stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, <hi>Miniſter at</hi> Badernock, <hi>met with by a Company of Diſſenters.</hi> This is a groſs Lie: Theſe five Armed Men who aſſaulted his Houſe (having done the like to a Gentlemans Houſe, and a Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Houſe, the ſame Night, ſeeking Arms, or Plunder) were no Diſſenters, of any ſort or way, but Debauched Men, horrid Swearers, and Curſers, who were of broken deſperate Fortunes; their Names are <hi>John Momillan, Patrick Motarged, George Tomoch, Archibald Ferguſon, Archibald Shinning.</hi> This one paſſage, duely
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33452:4"/> conſidered, might diſcredit all that is aſſerted in his Book, and expoſe the Author as a malicious Calumniator, deſigning to fix all the Thefts, Robberies, and other Villanies, that are committed in the Country, not only on ſome Presbyterian or other; but on the whole party. It is alſo witneſſed that Mr. <hi>Stirling</hi>'s Pariſh gave him all the help and ſuccour they could in this his trouble. This Mr. <hi>Stirling</hi> was afterwards deprived by the State, for not Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor Praying, after which time he behoved to remove from the Church, and Dwelling-houſe, but to this day liveth peaceably in the Pariſh. Yea Mr. <hi>Stirling</hi> himſelf diſowned that account of his Caſe which is in the Pamphlet, as what he had no hand in. For the two following Mr. <hi>Duncan</hi> of <hi>Kilpatrick Eaſter,</hi> and the Miniſter that was to preach at <hi>Boiall:</hi> In the Narration of what concerneth <hi>Kilpatrick Eaſter,</hi> there is a groſs Lie: None touched Mr. <hi>Duncan,</hi> nor did any perſonal hurt to him: Which is affirmed by them who know that Matter: And may be confirmed by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that that parties Zeal led them no farther than to rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of theſe Miniſters who had been ſuch a burden to them. For that Man who was to preach at <hi>Boiall;</hi> the Truth of the Story is, A great many came with a Burial to the Church-yard; among them, not above ſix or ſeven had Arms, who did always bear Arms: None of them made any Oppoſition: Only they ſent to the Miniſter of the Pariſh to deſire him to give them the Keys of the Church; ſeeing he himſelf could not Preach; He promiſed to do it, if the Heritors ſhould demand them; which ſeveral of them did; and offered to ſuffer him to ſtay in the houſe forty days, if he would give up the Keys: He contrary to his promiſe, refuſed to give them up; but went away that day, and carried away his Furniture, except ſome Lumber which the People after took out of the Houſe, in preſence of his Brother, and Man-ſervant; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the leaſt hurt to them.</p>

He beginneth with taking notice, that <hi>Epiſcopacy was aboliſhed by the Parliament, on account of its being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the inclinations of the People, and ſo may be reſtored by another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But he ſhould have conſidered, that whatever motive the Eſtates went on, it is declared againſt in the <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> as a Grievance; and therefore cannot be reſtored without overturning the Foundation of our preſent Civil Settlement. That <hi>Presbytery was never Setled by Law, except in times of trouble and danger to the State, by the practices of that Party;</hi> I have ſufficiently refuted in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33452:4"/> my <hi>former Vindication on Queſt.</hi> 2. <hi>P.</hi> 11. He taketh notice of a three fold turning out of Miniſters, <hi>By the Rabble, by the Convention of Eſtates, and by the Council;</hi> For the firſt, he truly ſaith that it was no wonder, being in the Interval of Government (if he had added that it was done by a People rendred mad, by the Oppreſſions of theſe Men who ſuffered from them, he had done well) but he <hi>thinketh ſtrange that it was not redreſſed, when the Government was Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</hi> This is anſwered in anſwer to Account of Perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Next, he giveth us an account of <hi>the diſaffection of the</hi> Weſtern <hi>Shires to Epiſcopacy,</hi> of <hi>their compliance when Perſecution grew hot:</hi> Which we deny to have been ſo univerſal as he would have it: Tho' I deny not that many put ſome force on their Light: Alſo, their complyances ſo far as to hear theſe men, when they could hear none elſe, is no Obligation on them to cleave to them as their Miniſters: Eſpecially when opportunity was put in their Hands to hear others. Wherefore it is no Imputation, nor blame, that when a Liberty was given for Meeting-houſes, they made uſe of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Neither are their Addreſſes to be blamed, wherein they acknowledge the goodneſs of God, and thank men, for that Liberty, which, tho' their due, had been detained from them. Tho' his <hi>Wiſe men told them that the Liberty was granted to bring in Popery;</hi> Yet as Wiſe men as they, thought, that the beſt way to keep it out was to make uſe of the Liberty, for ſetting people in the right way; and to beware of countenancing, approving of, or concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in, any thing that might promote Popery: Such as, owning the <hi>Diſpenſing Power</hi> (which he moſt injuriouſly imputeth to them) and concurring for taking away the <hi>Penal Laws againſt Popery,</hi> But of theſe things I have ſufficiently diſcourſed in my <hi>former Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication;</hi> as alſo of what followeth, that there were few Meeting Houſes at firſt: But that <hi>this is a kind of Demonſtration of the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the People toward Epiſcopacy,</hi> I ſee not; nor underſtand what kind of Demonſtration it is, unlels it be a Paralogyſm: Next he giveth account of <hi>Two ſorts of Presbyterians,</hi> viz. <hi>Hill men</hi> (as he calleth them) <hi>and others:</hi> And doth untruly, and not without Malice againſt the Sober Presbyterians, aſſert, that the former acted more conſequentially to Presbyterian principles: The contrary of which is evident in this, (as in many more things, that might be mentioned) that two or three Preachers ſeparated from all the reſt of the Church, and refuſed ſubjection to their Meetings.</p>

               <p>§ 5. In what followeth this Author dealeth more ingenuouſly than the former that I dealt with: For he imputed the Rabling work to the Presbyterians in General; this Man layeth it only on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:33452:5"/> the <hi>Cameronians;</hi> but even them he foully miſ-repreſenteth; while he ſpeaketh <hi>of their Eating and drinking plentifully at the expence of them whom they Rabled:</hi> All the Reports that we have of them, give account of their <hi>not Laying their hands on the Prey,</hi> as it is ſaid of the Jews after <hi>Haman</hi>'s Perſecution, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 9. 15, 16. But what is here aſſerted falſly in general, we ſhall have after more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: Where it ſhall be Examined. In his Hiſtorical account of things that followeth, page, 6<hi>th</hi> I have nothing to obſerve, but that he prevaricateth in alledging the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi>'s Declaration, <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. 1689. Which only ſaith that <hi>every one ſhall enjoy the Opinion and forms of worſhip, with the ſame freedom, and in the ſame manner as they enjoyed it in</hi> October <hi>laſt:</hi> But ſaith nothing of reſtoring any thing which they loſt, as he alledgeth, but leaveth that to be done by regular and legal Methods. That which followeth, is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the tumult at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> upon the Epiſcopal Miniſters Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuming the Pulpit, after the Princes Declaration, that none ſhould diſturb one another in matters of Religion: This is more fully ſet down in his 2<hi>d</hi> Collection of Papers, P. 50. <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Magiſtrates and Miniſters Aſſembled, and reſolved, that the Miniſters ſhould Preach,</hi> Feb. 17. <hi>as was uſual: In order to this, they, by the chief Magiſtrate then in Town, required the Captain of the Guard to lay down Arms, as the declaration enjoyned; He refuſed: After this, the People that uſed to meet in the Hills, and they of the Meeting-houſes, whiſpered together about their Bloody Deſigns againſt the Miniſter and his People, On the</hi> Sunday <hi>they hindered the ringing of ſome of the Bells: They publickly threatned the People as they went to Church; they purſued a Miniſter, who eſcaped, by going into a Houſe: The Magiſtrates going to Church found it Surrounded by a Rabble, whom they deſired to go home in peace; but they Railed at the Magiſtrates, and aſſaulted them with Staves and Battons; gave a blow to</hi> John Bell <hi>one of the late Baillies; the Magiſtrates ordered the Towns Servants and Officers to beat off the Rabble, and ſo went into the Church; in time of Sermon the pretended Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guard came into the Church, crying aloud that the Town was in Arms: Toward the end the Rabble, conducted by the Laird of</hi> Carſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>fired into it: A Boy was wounded in the Face; they brake open the Doors ſearched for the Parſon and found him. They refuſe to go home when the Magiſtrates required them: They took the People out of Church by fours and fives, and expoſed them to the fury of the Rabble: Many were Wounded, and Rudely treated: and not a few Perſons of ſome note,</hi> This Narrative (which I have abridged but not altered) is ſigned by <hi>James Gibſon</hi> Baillie, <hi>John Gilhagie, Patrick Bell.</hi> For anſwer to all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:33452:5"/> this; it is in the 1<hi>ſt.</hi> place to be conſidered, that little Faith is to be given to his Aſſertions; and that on two accounts; one is, the lying Stories that he had told of the People of <hi>Glaſgow, Page</hi> 39. 40. As, that on <hi>Thurſday January</hi> 17. 1689. The Miniſter did not enter into the Church. Alſo what is ſaid about Mr. <hi>Alexander George</hi> is falſe. They did no more but ſearch for the Keys of the Church Door and tore his Gown: Which we do not approve. They had been provoked by his Railing in a Sermon againſt our Reformers <hi>Luther, Calvin, Knox,</hi> &amp;c. Not only ſo, but abundance of Lies are inter-ſperſed in the narrative of the tumult at the high Church, <hi>Feb.</hi> 17. As <hi>that a pernicious Rout ſurrounded the Church:</hi> It was only a few Women ſtood in the Church Door. <hi>That the Magiſtrates went to the Church with the Miniſter</hi> is falſe: For only Baily <hi>Gibſon</hi> was there: That theſe Women or any elſe aſſaulted the Miniſter, or People, is falſe; for his party were the firſt Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors: It is alſo falſe <hi>that</hi> 600 <hi>of the beſt quality in Town entered the Church without Arms:</hi> For there were not in all above 200; and not 40 of ſuch quality; and they (or many of them) were armed with Piſtols, Swords, Clubs with Nails in the ends of them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is falſe, <hi>that the Miniſters party ſuffered ſuch things as he ſaith.</hi> For moſt, and they of the beſt quality, who were there, do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that no ſuch thing was done to them, but that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians conveyed them home in ſafety. Likewiſe what is ſaid of their reſpect to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Declaration, is a lying pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; for it is well known, they have never ſhewed any reſpect to him, nor to his Government, but the contrary is apparent in their whole Conduct. It is alſo to be conſidered that the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes brought to atteſt the Story, are not competent: <hi>James Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was a party, and made a Baily by the Archbiſhop, and all knew the Prelates Inclinations towards the preſent Civil Government. <hi>John Gilhagie</hi> is lookt on by all as a Fooliſh and Raſh Man, who lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſidereth what he doth: <hi>Patrick Bell,</hi> and his Brother, were, ſoon after, ſeized for Treaſonable practices; were long in Priſon, and are now under Bail. The truth in oppoſition to his lying Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is this: The Epiſcopal Miniſters in the Town being thruſt from their Churches by the Rabble, before the Government was ſetled, the Provoſt, <hi>Walter Gibſon,</hi> (who had been choſen by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop) made a paction with the Presbyterians, (for preventing Confuſion) That the Keys of all the Churches ſhould be depoſited in the hands of two Men till the Convention of Eſtates ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine in the matter; inſtead of this, he being abſent (may be
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:33452:6"/> of purpoſe) his Brother, <hi>Baily Gibſon,</hi> hired a Company of Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, armed as is above expreſt; who with one Miniſter (a ſimple Man, whom they prevailed with) went to the Church, and found forty Women in the Door, fell on them and ſadly wounded thirty two of them in a moſt Barbarous manner. The noiſe of this raiſed ſome of the Hill-men, who were in Town, who beat Drums, and got to Arms; this occaſioned the ſcattering of the Meeting-houſes (who were quietly hearing the Word) ſome of the Sober Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians dealt with the Hill-men, and endeavoured an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: Only ſome of the Friends of the Women who had been Wounded, could not be reſtrained from Violence: But what they did was nothing like what the Women had ſuffered: The Actors in this Tragedy who beat and wounded the Women, were <hi>James Gibſon</hi> Bailey, <hi>John Bell,</hi> Commiſſar <hi>Robertſon, George Robertſon,</hi> and his two Sons, <hi>John Robertſon, John Wat, <gap reason="illegible: omitted in print" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

In <hi>p.</hi> 7. and 8, Of the Narrative, he telleth us, <hi>that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of calling theſe Hill-men to an account for their diſorders, theſe very men coming Armed to</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>had the thanks of the Houſe given them for their good ſervice, and are ſtill a part of the ſtanding Forces of that Kingdom:</hi> This he inſiſteth farther upon in the fourth Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of paſſages <hi>page</hi> 90, 91. where he ſetteth down the Act of the Convention.

Here I obſerve a few things (referring the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Anſwer to Account of Perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Letter 1. § 8.) 1. it cannot be made appear, That that Body of Men Acted what he imputeth to the Rabble, yea it is evidently falſe, for he ſaith they were 8000, and in military order: The Rabble were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Companies, ſometimes not above ten or twelve, or forty, or an hundred, and that under no fixed command; if there were ſome among them who came to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> who alſo were the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 'tis not to be wondered at, for it is often ſo in Armies that are in hoſtile oppoſition one to another. 2. That they were in Arms againſt Law, is falſe: For they were called by the Authority of the States, as their Guard, when their Enemies had gathered a Formidable party into <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> 3. That they hindered the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Members, for the Convention, is alſo falſe. Himſelf and Complices, in their accounts of theſe Elections, aſſign cauſes of ſuch Members being choſen, inconſiſtent with this Force; <hi>viz.</hi> The negligence of their party. But <hi>Oportet mendacem eſſe bene me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem.</hi> 4. Tho' they were together before the Earl of <hi>Leven</hi> got the Command, yet not before they were called together by the Eſtates. 5. That they affronted either the Biſhops, or the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is more than can be made out: Or that I have heard from any good hand. 6. That theſe Men are part of the ſtanding Forces of the Kingdom (tho' there were no abſurdity if it were ſo) is falſe. They were totally disbanded, a Regiment was indeed rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in that Countrey, a long time after: And new Officers were ſet over them: And if any of the ſame Men were liſted Souldiers, it was accidental: But it is well known, that that Regiment hath done more Service to the King and Countrey, than others have done.

He ſaith alſo, <hi>that ſome of them ſuffered the loſs of Children;</hi> which is above made appear to be falſe, in the only inſtance that was brought.

               <p>§ 7. <hi>The fulſome and flattering Expreſſions in the Presbyterian Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to King</hi> James <hi>for their Liberty, their approving of the Diſpenſing Power,</hi> which he taxeth, <hi>page</hi> 9. are his own imaginations, other Men can ſee no ſuch thing in that Addreſs. That <hi>they never preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the diſorders of the Rabble,</hi> is falſe: Though we thought not fit to make that our conſtant Theme. And if but few did it, it was becauſe they who were Actors in that Scene, little regarded the preaching of the ſober Presbyterians: And they ſhould have loſt their ſweet Words. Theſe practices of the Rabble were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly ſpoken againſt by Miniſters both before they were acted, for preventing them, and after, for reproving them, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like. That the Presbyterians poſſeſſed their places when called to them, it was their Right; both by their ſtanding Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their people, from whom they had been thruſt away in <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. And alſo by the Act of Parliament giving all Miniſters then put out, regreſs to their Charges: And indeed they who had been by the Biſhops put into their places were Intruders, and if any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to other places, on the Call of the people, to which they had not ſuch former Relation, there was no blame; becauſe there being no probable regreſs for the former Incumbents, it was not reaſonable that the people ſhould continue deſtitute of the Goſpel. Beſide that there was never a Relation of Paſtor and people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and theſe Flocks, they never having conſented to ſuch a Relation. For what he ſaith of the <hi>Right of Patrons,</hi> I think there were but few Miniſters Fixed before it was legally made void: And if they were, we think that Right was only founded on the Law; but was contrary to Chriſts Inſtitution: And it was known to be about expiring, and therefore it was not contrary to a good Conſcience, to accept of a Call to a people, without the Patron. It is true, in that Caſe they could have no Right to the Stipend: But the Conſent of Miniſter and people, the Authority of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Church Judicatory being interpoſed, could well fix a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Miniſter and People, without the Patron. He doth next fall heavily on the Convention of Eſtates (for theſe Men hide not their Treaſonable Speeches againſt the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State;) <hi>That it is no wonder that many thought that the Deſign of ſome who were zealous for the Revolution, was more to deſtroy the Epiſcopal Clergy, than to ſettle the Nation, or preſerve our Religion,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33452:7"/> 
                  <hi>Liberties and Properties.</hi> This I leave to them to Anſwer who have power to correct ſuch petulancy: He further laſheth the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Council, for their Acts with reſpect to the Miniſters caſt out in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Shires. Neither ſhall I meddle with him on this Head: He hath not yet done with our Rulers: But blameth them for the <hi>Proclamation for Praying for King</hi> William <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary. And puniſhing Men for not obeying it ſo ſuddenly. This I have anſwered on Letter 2. Sect. 17. All that followeth to <hi>page</hi> 14. is already anſwered in the forecited place: Only he hath a new Argument in Defence of them who did not read or pray, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the Proclamation was not ſent to them from the Biſhops.</hi> As if the Eſtates could not imploy what Officers they pleaſed to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize, for ſignifying their Mind to the Miniſters, <hi>page</hi> 14. Even the King ſhall not eſcape his Cenſure; becauſe, <hi>while he extended Clemency to Criminals, he did not ſo to the Clergy:</hi> Who were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willing to obey his Commands nor pray for him; nor ſo much as own Him for their King. And it is indeed an Act of Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which few Kings ever ſhewed, to allow ſuch to be in publick Churches, and to have the conduct of the Conſciences of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: I am ſure this is not the way to have the people principled with Loyalty; though that was the main Theme that theſe Men inſiſted on in the former Reigns. What followeth is his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on a Debate in Parliament, about impoſing the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, and why it was not impoſed on the Clergy: He ſaith, <hi>It was out of reſpect to the Presbyterian Preachers, leſt they ſhould ſcruple it: They being unwilling to come under Allegiance to King</hi> William <hi>till firſt he had ſetled their Church Government:</hi> And he thinks <hi>ſome will not take it till the Covenant be renewed.</hi> Here is bold judging and cenſuring the ſecret thoughts and purpoſes of the Eſtates: As alſo moſt calumnious Imputations on the Presbyterians; Did ever any of them refuſe the Oath of Allegiance? Have not many of them (even as many as were required on any occaſion) chearfully taken it? And that though the Covenant be not renewed, Did ever any of them move ſuch a ſcruple about it? Yea it is manifeſt, that it is not their principle ſo to bargain with their Kings about Allegiance: For they were ready to ſwear it (and did when called) to Kings who unſetled their Church Government; and who enacted the abjuring of the Covenant. What followeth <hi>page</hi> 15, 16. about Miniſters being deprived for not reading and praying, is anſwered in <hi>Letter</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 17. He odiouſly compareth the <hi>States dealing with the Clergy, with that of the French with the Proteſtants there, who</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:33452:8"/> 
                  <hi>ſaved their Life and Fortune if they change their Religion; but Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers here are turned out by the Rabble. Anſ.</hi> If he can ſhew that this is done here by Authority, as in <hi>France</hi> the Perſecution is acted; or that the Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> ſuffered in a time of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> by a people that had been ſo barbarouſly injured and enraged by them: Then ſhould he ſpeak to the purpoſe; otherways his parallel doth no ways hold. They had made themſelves juſtly loathſom, and a burden to the people, who took their opportunity to be rid of them, without ſuch Barbarous uſage of them as they had ſuffered from them. And the Eſtates thought it not fit to impoſe that burden again, on a people who had been ſo cruſh'd by it; what is there here that hath any Affinity with the Caſe of the Sufferings in <hi>France?</hi>

He pretendeth <hi>page</hi> 16, and 17. to remove a Miſ-informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, given to them of <hi>England: That the Clergy were not deprived by the Council for not reading and praying, unleſs they were Immoral in their Converſation:</hi> And from this he laboureth to vindicate them. Much of which is anſwered above; only the Reader may know, that this was never alledged, nor given as the reaſon of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation by any of us: Whatever might poſſibly be talked in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by them who knew little of our Affairs.

Was it not ſo at the Reformation from Popery? How far did the number of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts exceed that of Proteſtant Miniſters? But what he hence inferreth, hath no weight; <hi>viz. That many of the Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt be removed leſt they ſhould over-vote the others:</hi> For a more rational and ſure courſe was taken to obviate it; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Government ſhould be ſetled only in the hands of Presbyterians, and ſuch as they ſhall receive; which he, or his Fellow Cenſurer of the State had above complained of, and we have vindicated. He concludeth this Narrative with a warning to the <hi>Church of</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:33452:8"/> England <hi>of the Enmity of Presbyterians againſt them, and their hazard from us.</hi> And indeed the ſtrain of theſe Pamphlets is moſtly a complaint againſt the King and Parliament, and all the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Nation, and an Appeal to the Church of <hi>England</hi> for deliverance from this Yoke: And I hope our Rulers will conſider them accordingly.</p>

Men uſe to ſlight what is aſſerted by a common Liar. We have next a general account of the <hi>Miniſters of the Presbytery of</hi> Irwin; <hi>that all their Houſes have been aſſaulted, their Gowns torn, and they diſcharged to preach; many of their Wives and Children turned out of Doors, like to ſtarve by Hunger and Cold in the Winter; ſome forced to fly and lurk, that they cannot meet to make known their Grievances: Only three or four give theſe accounts from their own knowledge, and certain information Signed Charles Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>john</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Larg, Alexander Laing</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Stewartoun.</hi>

The anſwer of all this we take out of the Accuſation it ſelf. It was done by Mr. <hi>Houſtoun,</hi> and his Party: A man who not only is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned by the Sobereſt ſort of Presbyterians, but even by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronians;</hi> as of moſt unſound Principles, and moſt immoral practices. Followeth a Letter Signed by four Miniſters <hi>George Gregory, Francis Fordyce, William Irwine,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Kirkmichael, John Hog</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Ochiltry.</hi> What is not repeated out of the former Stories, and anſwered before, is, <hi>the People of the Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe Battering and Bruiſing the Miniſter of</hi> Kirkmichaels <hi>Man-ſervant, commanding him to remove with what was his Maſters from the Houſe. Anſ.</hi> It is witneſſed under the Hands of <hi>David Bell, James Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cart, Thomas Craig, William Niven;</hi> all of that Pariſh: That they were preſent when one <hi>Robert Donaldſon</hi> with ſome others, came to the Miniſter of <hi>Kirkmichlaes</hi> Houſe, and that they did not beat, or uſe any Violence to the Miniſters Man ſervant: But only took the Communion Cups from him, and that they two drank together, and ſhook Hands at Parting: And that the ſaid Servant lived there peaceably a year after, and diſpoſed of the Crop of his Maſters Glebe.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:33452:9"/> 
                  <hi>George Monaught;</hi> that the forementioned <hi>Robert Donaldſon</hi> who was ſaid to uſe Violence in the houſe of the Miniſter of <hi>Kirkmichael,</hi> was a common Robber, and had Robbed ſeveral Houſes in <hi>Carrick:</hi> And that he, nor his Complices did belong to no Meeting-Houſe: That they apprehended him and carried him before the Baily De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of <hi>Carrick</hi> who ſent him to Priſon. Is it not a malicious Lye, to impute this Fact to the Presbyterians of the Meeting-houſe? Followeth the poſſeſſing of ſome Churches: Which is above An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered. Then we have a large Hiſtory Signed by the <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Livingſton, Mr. George Honeyman, <hi>and</hi> John Park <hi>Clerk to the Synod of</hi> Edinburgh: <hi>How</hi> 30 <hi>Armed men came to his Houſe, Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Wife, who had lyen but eight days in Child-bed, carried away what they thought fit: Took his Horſe and the Beddels Horſe (which they ſent back next day) a month after they ſearched the Houſe for the Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſometime after that they Summoned him to Remove:</hi> All this we deny to have been done by any of our Communion. Yea the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons given to him and others for removing (a Copy of which our Author doth furniſh us with) doth ſhew it was done by a party of People who had been enraged by the cruel Perſecutions that they had ſuffered from theſe Men. We are far from approving ſuch Irregularities, but the World will not think it ſtrange that they, who inſtead of feeding their flock, had worried them, ſhould meet with ſuch things from a People ſo highly provoked. I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a large Paper of the manifold Sufferings of that Pariſh, by Mr. <hi>Honeymans</hi> Malice and influence: Atteſted by about thirty Hands, but I forbear, to ſhun tediouſneſs. Such another ſtory we have of Mr. Man <hi>Miniſter at</hi> Bathgate <hi>whoſe Houſe they ſearched, alſo a Neighbours Houſe, at laſt found him, and with threatning by drawn Swords, and Guns preſented, demanded of him the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils of the Church, and Records of the Kirk-Seſſion, Tore his Gown, and Summoned him to remove.</hi> This hath the like Atteſtation with the former, <hi>Anſ.</hi> The People of <hi>Bathgate</hi> never owned Mr. <hi>Man</hi> he being placed there only by the Biſhop, without the conſent either of Patron or People, only in time of moſt ſevere Perſecution, many out of fear came to hear him; they were highly provoked by his Perſecuting of them. Of which there are clear and great Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; in his ſtirring up the Magiſtrates, and aſſiſting the Souldiers, to Ruine them. Next Mr. <hi>Norman Mokenzie, Miniſter at Mid Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and John Park, <hi>do witneſs, that</hi> January 27. <hi>being the Lords day, after Sermon, Eight Armed Men came to his Houſe, but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by ſome Gentlemen, who were there: In which ſcuffle three were</hi>

                  <hi>wounded.

As we do not approve any of theſe things being Acted without Authority; ſo we find this to be a Lying accuſation: For the Men who <hi>Feb.</hi> 1. came to the Houſe, carried civilly: Telling his Wife ſhe needed not fear: And that they would do no harm to her, or any Perſon in the Houſe. The Bond that <hi>Thomas Livingſtoun</hi> ſought for, was a Bond that the Miniſter had forced his Father to give for a Fine impoſed on him for Non-conformity. <hi>Alſo Mr.</hi> George Robert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Miniſter at</hi> Weſtcalder, <hi>had his Houſe ſearched for Arms, and an old Sword taken from him; and was ſummoned to remove, Witneſſed</hi> by himſelf and <hi>John Park, ut ſupra.</hi> Anſ. if this was done, the General anſwers above given is enough to vindicate the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians in General from the blame of it. and the time of confuſion, and provocations, that that poor ſuffering People had from moſt of that Party, may make us ceaſe to wonder at it.</p>

               <p>§ 11. In his ſecond Collection of Papers <hi>p.</hi> 50. we have account of the <hi>practice of the Rabble, after the Princes Declaration,</hi> againſt ſome Miniſters who afterward were deprived by the Council; by which inſtances he would make it appear, how little the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians regarded Authority, when it tended to reſtrain their diſorders. A general anſwer to all that is ſaid under this, may be gathered from what hath been before diſcourſed: <hi>viz,</hi> That much of what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged is either Lies, or Truth diſguiſed, and what was really done, was by Perſons whoſe Actions we are not concerned to defend. He beginneth with the Tumult at <hi>Glaſgow, Feb.</hi> 17. 1689. Which is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. The next is of Mr. <hi>Gideon Brown Miniſter at Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holme, atteſted by himſelf alone.</hi> But others are offered as witneſſes if need be. Where it is Narrated, <hi>that</hi> George Dickſon <hi>a profeſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meronian</hi> (which is afterward ſaid to be a Preacher in a meeting) A <hi>Cotter to the Laird of</hi> Smalholme, <hi>firſt ſummoned Mr.</hi> Brown, <hi>to remove from the Church, and deſiſt from Preaching: Afterward forced him out of the Pulpit, uſing violence to his Son who offered to defend him. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that he perſecuted them as they alledged; but that often he ſaved them from the Laſh of the Law.</hi> This ſtory hath its anſwer in it ſelf: For the man was a <hi>Cameronian,</hi> and the Actions of that party we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33452:10"/> approved, neither can, nor will we defend them: beſides, the pariſh do witneſs that he was a violent perſecutor, and give inſtances of it under the hands of credible witneſſes: Which ſhall be ſhewed to any who deſireth to be informed. Our next inſtance is of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Bullo,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Stobo; whom the Rabble uſed moſt Barbarouſly, all the Winter, and frighted his Wife and Children into Sickneſs, and he was forced to lodge in the Fields in the Winter Weather. About the beginning of</hi> April, <hi>as he was riding through a Village in the Pariſh, there came out of the Houſe of the Preacher in the Meeting houſe, his Servant, and a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who with Swords and Guns charged him to Stand, he fleeing from them, they fired Guns after him, they mounting on Horſe Back, purſued and took him, they threatned to ſhoot him, and bid him Pray before he ſhould Die. When he told them they were in Paſſion; They ſaid, you Damn'd Rogue, do ye admoniſh us, ſo they Beat him with their Swords, and ſaid they would ſpare him for that Night, and Sentence, and execute him next Morning, ſo, they convened many of the Pariſh, cauſed tear his Gown, diſcharged him to Preach: And on the day that he ſhould have read the Proclamation, they hindred him by force from entring the Church, yet was he after deprived by the Council for not Reading and Praying. Anſ.</hi> In this Narrative, are many Lies: which is atteſted by Mr. <hi>William Ruſſel,</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Stobo:</hi> As that his Wife and Children fell ſick by fear: None of them were ſick that year. That he lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Fields; for he never lodged a night in the Fields, only one night two young men came to his houſe, he was not within, but in a Neighbours houſe hard by. His Wife ſaid to them that he was in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> he withdrew a little and returned as ſoon as they were gone, and ſaid that he would not have fled if he had thought they were ſo few, but have Piſtoled them both; it is alſo falſe that any came out of the Preachers houſe on him as he Rode; but theſe two young men being provoked with his ſpeaking of Piſtoling them, came out of another Houſe, and called to ſpeak with him; He fled, the Preachers man came out to ſee what the Fray was, one of the young Men followed him on Horſeback, did no harm to him, but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Caſe with him: He alledging that all the Honeſt men in the Pariſh owned him: They brought ten or twelve whom he Named as ſuch, who yet diſowned him. It is moſt falſe that he was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to read the Proclamation; he did read a part of it: It is true ſome moved to hinder him from Preaching, but the Presbyterian Miniſter reſtrained them. It is a groſs untruth, that he was willing to read and Pray, and yet deprived for it; For he ſaid before the Council that he had not Prayed for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary:</hi> That his Gown was torn, is alſo a groſs Lye.</p>

The Story of Mr. <hi>Little</hi> (which nextfolloweth) is above anſwered, in Anſwer to <hi>Account of Perſecution Letter</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 13 Next we have account of the Sufferings of Mr. <hi>Archibald Ferguſon Miniſter at</hi> Kirkpatrick, <hi>whom the Rabble, Men and Women, Aſſaulted in his Houſe: When he calmly asked the reaſon, they knocked him on the Head with a Piſtol, ſo that he fell: His Wife daily expecting the pains of Child-birth, they knocked down with the Butt-end of a Musket: He received many mercileſs Blows, and was ſorely bruiſed: Himſelf they dragged into a pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; the Women cut and tore off his Cloaths; even to the uncovering of his Nakedneſs; be at him on the Shins with a Club, commanded him to be gone, and forced him in his Wounds to leave his Houſe, Family, and Church.</hi> Before I examine the matter of this Story, I take notice of the bitter Sarcaſms, and cruel Mockings againſt all the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, with which it is interſperſed, as if this Fact were to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the Party, who yet do abhor ſuch practices as much as any Men can do.

A further Anſwer was delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when this was written, expecting Information from ſuch as know the Circumſtances of this Story: But that Account not being as yet come to Hand, when this ſheet is printing off (by whoſe fault I know not) I can only ſay, that the many Lying Stories that are in this Book, may derogate from the Credibility of this: If it be true, we abhor the Fact, and wiſh that the Actors may be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Puniſhment for ſuch Inhumanity.</p>

               <p>§ 13. In his third Collection of Papers (which concerneth them who complied, and yet ſuffered) he beginneth with Mr. <hi>William Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton, who firſt at</hi> Irwin, <hi>then at</hi> Kirk-newtoun, <hi>was put from his Houſe and Church, by the Rabble, and very hardly uſed. Anſ.</hi> That theſe things acted againſt him were not the deed of the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor approved by the Church, is evident from this, that Mr. <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> is in good eſteem among the Presbyterians, and is now received as one of themſelves, into a ſhare of the Government with them: Wherefore if ſuch things were done againſt him, it was not by the ſober Presbyterians, but by a ſort of Men who are not of our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:33452:11"/> Communion, and who have ſhewed diſlike againſt us alſo. For the Truth of what he alledgeth to have been done, I can meet with none who can affirm what our Author ſaith; and therefore have cauſe to ſuſpect it as of the ſame ſtrain with others of his Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He telleth us next how Mr. <hi>Samuel Nimmo was hindred to Preach by ſome of the Earl of</hi> Argile'<hi>s Regiment.</hi> If this were true, it was the Deed of ſome <hi>Cameronians,</hi> not approved by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians. And I hope hindring a man to Preach (tho we allow not that it be done in a diſorderly way) doth not amount to ſo horrid a Perſecution as he crieth out of. His next complaint concerneth Mr. <hi>Selkirk</hi> at <hi>Glenholm</hi> in <hi>Tweddale, who Read and Prayed, was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome of the meaneſt of the People, to remove from his Dwelling, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained from them a fortnight for that end, ſome put another Lock on the Church door to keep him out: Of this he had no Redreſs.</hi> This we are far from allowing; but ſtill here is nothing like the <hi>French Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gooning.</hi> He ſaith that he complained and had no Redreſs: But we neither know whom to blame, nor how to make enquiry about the Truth of it, ſeeing he is not pleaſed to let us know who did thus deny Juſtice to him. It is ſufficiently atteſted that this was done by Strangers: that they took two of Mr. <hi>Selkirks</hi> Elders into the Houſe with them, who might witneſs that they uſed no violence, and that he and they parted peaceably: And that afterward he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his Charge, and the Presbytery gave him a Teſtimonial. Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> (he doth not tell where he was Miniſter) is the next ſubject of Complaint: <hi>His Church was poſſeſſed by the Rabble, ſent by Mr.</hi> Walker <hi>Preacher in the Meeting-houſe; by the connivance of Mr.</hi> Mowat, <hi>who is Old and Infirm: The Heretors were offended that Mr</hi> Walker <hi>invaded Mr.</hi> Mowats <hi>right. The Rabble hindred Mr.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs <hi>to Preach; and when he objected King</hi> Williams <hi>Authority, they ſpoke of it with contempt. Anſ.</hi> Mr. <hi>Mowat,</hi> and the Pariſh had cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> to his help: The people hearing of the Act for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the old Miniſters (not conſidering that it was only Voted, but had not the Royal Aſſent, which it afterward had) met in the Church; Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> diſſwaded them: Yet was forced to Preach to them there: There was no Tumult: the whole Pariſh was met: Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi>'s Bedle opened the Church door to them. It is falſe, that any of the people did contemn King <hi>William</hi>'s Authority: There were indeed three young Men, who ſome days after, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi> to Preach: But this was not approved by the reſt: nor was ever any violence offered to him: What the Paper ſaith of Arms, and beating a Drum, is falſe: The Pariſh had been
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:33452:12"/> at a Rendezvous; whence they came to a Burial, but that they made uſe of Arms or Drum, at or near Mr. <hi>Burgeſs</hi>'s Houſe, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together falſe. The ſufferings of Mr. <hi>David Spence</hi> followeth, That <hi>He was diſcharged to Preach in</hi> January 1689. <hi>by Strangers, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing till</hi> April, <hi>he was forcibly hindred to Preach and to Read the Proclamation, on the day appointed for it, though he was willing to do it: On complaint, he had protection, from the Committee of Eſtates; yet in</hi> September <hi>he was deprived for not Reading. Anſ.</hi> In the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Council I find him deprived for that he confeſſed he had neither Read nor Prayed: But not a word of the Plea he uſed for his Omiſſion: So that this is to be look'd on as a groſs prevarication, and malicious deſign to defame the Government: For the Rabble hindering him to Preach before he was deprived: We do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, nor was it done by any of our Communion. What is ſaid of ſome Miniſters in the Presbytery of <hi>Stranrawer,</hi> we ſhall meet with it in a Pamphlet that peculiarly inſiſteth on their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; wherefore I now paſs over it. Mr. <hi>Francis Scot of Tweed-mure was caſt out by the Rabble.</hi> This we do not defend, nor are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Anſwer for it. <hi>Mr.</hi> Aliſon <hi>of</hi> Rilbucho <hi>was caſt out after he had been cleared by the Council, having given all Obedience, and his Goods were deſtroyed by ſome Women; and a Presbyterian poſſeſſeth his Church, neither can he get any redreſs.</hi> What application he hath made for redreſs, and who hath been faulty in denying it to him we cannot enquire, for our Author is not particular; but thought it ſafeſt to Reproach the Presbyterians in general Terms. All that remains in this third Collection of Papers is ſome Letters ſent to <hi>London</hi> to my Lord <hi>Elphingſton complaining of the injuſtice done to Mr.</hi> Paul Gelly <hi>Miniſter of</hi> Airth: <hi>In that he was deprived by the Council on the Teſtimony of two perjured Perſons, whereas he had given all Obedience, and he hath a good Teſtimony from moſt of the Pariſh. Anſ.</hi> They that teſtifie for him are of his own party: They did not teſtifie any thing before the Council in his Vindication: The Witneſſes againſt him were neither accuſed before any Court, nor convicted of any thing that ſhould derogate from the Credibility of their Teſtimony: They teſtified not only that he did not Read and Pray, but that he prayed for the Reſtoration of King <hi>James,</hi> and exhorted the people to pray ſo in private: And ſaid, <hi>That he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a Reformation, but they had got a wicked Tyranny, and Ungodly Rulers: And that people were not ſecure of Life and Fortune; all this is atteſted by the Records of the Council.</hi>

In his fourth and laſt Collection of Papers, he hath the Proclamations, Acts of Convention and Council, Addreſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That he thinketh may beſpatter the Presbyterians: Theſe Papers need none of my Apology for them. Wherefore I ſhall only take notice of his little Remarks on them, whereby he doth moſt petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly reproach the Government, as well as the Presbyterians. Some Obſervations he maketh on the Proclamation of the Eſtates for praying for King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which are above anſwered: One I now take notice of, which is, <hi>That the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Preachers were not queſtioned for neglecting to read the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to pray according to it, though others were. Anſ.</hi> I know not that any of them were guilty of this neglect: And if any were, there was no Information againſt them; and therefore no pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment could follow. He next dealeth with the Addreſſes of the Presbyterians to King <hi>James</hi> for the Liberty granted them by him; and taketh notice, <hi>that they were ready to comply with a Popiſh Prince, and did not keep their promiſe of Duty and Allegiance to him.</hi> I take no notice of his profane mocking, in the ſtrain of what he ſaith: But to the thing, I anſwer, They no farther complied with a Popiſh Prince, than to live peaceably under him, and to uſe the Goſpel-priviledge that they had been violently deprived of, which was now reſtored to them; and had not his party their Liberty al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſecured to them, by the ſame King? Yea they concurred to ſet him up, and to advance his Supremacy and Arbitrary Power, by which he was put in Capacity to deſtroy our Religion, which we never did: For promiſes of Duty and Allegiance, we keeped them ſo long as he was King, but when the Nation laid him aſide, and chuſed another, the obligation of our Allegiance was changed, and we beſtowed it where the Nation had placed it: As alſo did the Church of <hi>England</hi> their great Patrons. But this Man and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, declare their diſlike of our King, and Civil Government, on all occaſions as much as they do againſt our Church way. His next effort againſt the Convention and Government, is from a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter written by the Viſcount of <hi>Dundee,</hi> whom he calleth <hi>The Great,</hi> (which is on the Matter an owning of that Rebellion that he was the Head of) the Letter and this Authors remark on it, tend to condemn the Convention of Eſtates of Injuſtice. This matter I have above touched. It is falſe <hi>that he was living in peace, and that he was in hazard of his Life by the Rabble.</hi> He had gathered a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable party to deſtroy the Convention of Eſtates, and they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a force for their ſecurity: And on this, he and others went
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:33452:13"/> away in Arms, and gathered a party in the <hi>Highlands.</hi> But on theſe things I inſiſt not, my buſineſs being mainly to vindicate the Presbyterian Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in her Principles and Actings. The Act of Council <hi>December</hi> 24. 1689. I have vindicated on Letter 2. He is pleaſed (and reckoneth it modeſty ſo to do) to call it a <hi>great stretch of Justice:</hi> Some Mens Necks have been made to ſtretch for a leſs Crime, than thus to reproach the Government. He ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 85. <hi>That the Miniſters outed by the Rabble are caſt out of the protection of the State.</hi> That is no further true, than that they were not reponed: The Reaſons of which are given on Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 2. It is maliciouſly repreſented, <hi>That the Rabble, and all their Enemies, were invited to be Witneſſes againſt them who yet were in place.</hi> For all were invited, but none were admitted but ſuch as were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable Witneſſes, <hi>Boni &amp; legales homines.</hi> Would he have none but his own party to be Witneſſes againſt them who deſpiſed the Government? He would fain ſay ſomething againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s <hi>Declaration, page</hi> 90. but can find nothing; but that <hi>the Rabble grew ſtrong by it, and they who had taken Arms</hi> (who were indeed King <hi>James</hi>'s party) <hi>were forced to Disband:</hi> This is that which grieveth him. What followeth of the Conventions thanks to them that had Guarded them againſt <hi>Dundee</hi>'s Plot, and his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on it, is diſcuſſed above on Letter 2. He obſerveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on the Proclamation for the Faſt, <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. 1689. But that he calleth it a Canting Proclamation. A word of contempt that theſe Men uſe for any thing that looketh like ſerious Religion. And that Mr. <hi>Ramſay,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Gardine were deprived for not Reading it:</hi> Which is falſe: For it was for praying for King <hi>James,</hi> as the account which he himſelf giveth doth make manifeſt. All that he obſerveth on the Proclamation ordering to whom the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Rents ſhould be paid (they being now laid aſide) is, <hi>That</hi> Alexander Hamiltoun <hi>of</hi> Kinkel, <hi>who was imployed as receiver for St.</hi> Andrews, <hi>was at</hi> Bothwel Bridge, <hi>and by the Clemency of the then Government had his Life ſpared.</hi> If all this were true what doth it make againſt the Presbyterians. He is known to be a faithful Man, and why might not the Government imploy him, ſeeing the former Government had ſpared him: But in truth, it was not ſo much the Clemency of the former Government, as no Crime could be proved againſt him, that ſaved his Life. His laſt Paper, for it ſeemeth that he is now at a Cloſe, and can ſay no more, is a <hi>draught of an Act for the Eſtabliſhment of the Government of the Church, given in to the Parliament by the Kings Commiſſioner, which,</hi> he ſaith,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33452:13"/> 
                  <hi>that the Presbyterians would not admit of, becauſe it reſtrained them from medling in State Affairs. Anſ.</hi> Many other Acts, as well as this, were given in, being drawn by private hands, to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Parliament, and were rejected or amended. That the Parliament rejected any of them, it was becauſe they ſaw them, or ſomewhat in them, to be inconvenient; but that he will fix on the particular cauſe, and lay this on the Presbyterians, is ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy boldneſs: Not only medling with the deſigns of the Legiſlators, which is not fit for a private Perſon, but with the ſecret thoughts of Men, which is fit for no Creature.</p>

The concluſion of his Book, conſiſting of five or ſix pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, I ſhall not much be concerned with; he there, more than before (which was needleſs) venteth his Spleen againſt the preſent Government of the State; And that in very undecent terms. He dealeth in moſt of it, with the Obſervator, whom I leave to plead his own cauſe. Though I have above Aſſerted, and Vindicated the Truth of moſt things for which he challengeth the Obſervator. His note about the Earl of <hi>Crafurd</hi>'s Letter, is a groundleſs Cavil. His Lordſhip doth not own that the Council took probation of Crimes of another Nature, beſide not Reading and Praying; but on the contrary, ſaid, that though they who framed the Libels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Epiſcopal Miniſters did ignorantly, in their Libels, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, either for their Opinion about Church Government, or Immoralities in their Converſation; yet, no regard was had to theſe, nor any queſtion made about them. He next taketh to task a Book Intituled, <hi>A brief and true account of the ſufferings of the Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>from the Epiſcopalians ſince the year</hi> 1660. which he ſaith, <hi>is written by a true-paced Presbyterian:</hi> And imputeth all the Aſſertions, and ſeverity of Stile in that Book, to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. This is an unfair, and injurious, and falſe imputation: Presbyterians diſown both the Stile, and many Principles vented in that Book; it was written by a Cameronian, while that party ſtood at a diſtance from the ſober Presbyterians, and from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them who bear that Name, as much as from the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. Though on the other hand; we know that there are many undeniable truths in it, as to the matter of Fact concerning theſe Sufferings; which I wiſh he, or any of his party, would undertake to diſprove. But it is ſtrange that this Gentleman ſhould quarrel the ſtile of that Book, ſeeing it is exactly conform to his own, in the bitterneſs and ill nature that appeareth in it: Only things are not there ſo foully miſ-repreſented as in his Paper. The Queries
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33452:14"/> with which he ſhutteth up this his Work, we are the leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, becauſe moſt of them are built upon the principles of that Book which we do not own: And others of them, on ſome Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Church in a time when both contending parties run a little too high in the heat of debate: Of which I have ſpoken what is ſufficient in my <hi>Former Vindication:</hi> Only a few things, not met with in that Paper, I now take notice of, <hi>That the presbyterians have riſen twice in Arms in King</hi> William'<hi>s time,</hi> is an impudent and falſe Aſſertion: For the firſt time that he mentioneth, it was a Rabble of <hi>Cameronians,</hi> not in a Body, but here and there, to throw out ſome of the Clergy who had ſeverely oppreſſed them: Of which I have told my Sentiment above. The other, <hi>A formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable number in an Hoſtile manner, making an Addreſs to the Council, telling them, That they would not lay down their Arms till the Council had diſcharged all Judicatories to pronounce any Sentence in Favour of Epiſcopal Miniſters.</hi> This was never heard of before; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Gentleman hath either Dreamed it, or Invented it. <hi>Page</hi> 107.

                     </gap>urped it to themſelves, having without his leave Convened at</hi> Edinburgh, <hi>and Voted themſelves into a free General Aſſembly. That they daily draw up Inſtructions for regulating the Parliament: That they Meet and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ at their pleaſure,</hi> For the firſt of theſe, it was not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but the Parliament (to which the King gave his Royal Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) which Voted away the Supremacy: And that, not any Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy that is due to any Man on Earth; but ſuch a one as the Pope had uſurped over the Church of God; and which ſome of our Kings had aſſumed, and under the former Government had been ſcrued up to that height that the King might overturn our Religion at his pleaſure. And it is highly to the Commendation of our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King, that he was pleaſed to give to God that which was his, and to reſerve only to himſelf what was <hi>Caeſars.</hi> For the ſecond, the Presbyterians uſurp no Supremacy, no Legiſlative, nor Coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive Power: They pretend to no more but a Miniſterial Power, in declaring the Laws of Chriſt, by his Authority, and in executing the Cenſures which he hath appointed for the breakers of theſe Laws. Thirdly, It is moſt falſe that they convened in the General Aſſembly without his leave, they had an expreſs Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, neither did the Aſſembly Meet or Adjourn, without the Kings Commiſſioner at any time; other Judicatories are by Law allowed to Meet and Adjourn, as they think fit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33452:14"/> their ſo doing is not without the Kings leave. We think it no ſmall mercy to have the Magiſtrates Countenance to our Meetings; tho' we think to deny any Intrinſick Power in the Church, to meet about the Affairs of Religion, were to condemn the Apoſtles and to allow Rulers, if they ſhould be either open or ſecret Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Truth, a power to Ruin all, at their pleaſure. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That they either daily, or at all, draw up Inſtructions for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the Parliament, is an Aſſertion ſo falſe and malicious, as none but a Man of this Authors Temper could be capable of: Nor can I imagine from whence he could take riſe for ſuch a Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. He hath another foul Untruth; <hi>That the Covenant is again Voted the Standard of all pure Religion</hi> I deſire to know of him where, when, or by whom, this was done: For they that live in <hi>Scotland</hi> know nothing of it. His talk <hi>of ſome holding that King</hi> Charles <hi>fell from the Crown, becauſe he brake the Covenant, and King</hi> James <hi>had no Right, becauſe he took it not;</hi> might perhaps be the principle of ſome of the wildeſt of the Hill-men, but never were the Opinions of ſound Presbyterians. His third <hi>Query</hi> deſerveth little Anſwer. We are far from thinking King <hi>William</hi> an Idolater; tho' we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the <hi>Engliſh Service:</hi> And our principles are known, that we owe Loyalty, and have paid it, even to an Idolatrous, (that is, a Popiſh) King. The fourth <hi>Query</hi> tendeth to engage the Rulers to bear down the Presbyterians in the <hi>North of Ireland;</hi> that Popery might prevail there; againſt which they have been the greateſt Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of that Nation. His fifth <hi>Query</hi> quarrelleth the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> for praying for their Brethren in <hi>Scotland;</hi> how reaſonably this is blamed, let the Reader judge. I never heard that they prayed for <hi>Scotland, as their Mother Church.</hi> In his ſixth <hi>Query,</hi> he ſhameleſly blameth Presbyterians for being againſt Toleration, (this I have anſwered in my former Vindication) whereas his own party are as rigid that way as any, except Papiſts, or theſe in <hi>Japan.</hi> For his laſt <hi>Query,</hi> which concerneth the Moderation of Presbyterians; it is our deſign and endeavour to grow in this, and in other Graces; and not to confine our ſelves to our own attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to what others had attained who went before us: And to ſet no bounds to it but what the Scripture ſetteth. I hope all this conſidered, the deſign of his <hi>Queries</hi> is loſt; which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the Presbyterians as not Loyal, nor firm to King <hi>William.</hi> Many wiſe Men think that he hath few in this Nation, beſide them, who are Cordially for his Intereſt.</p>

That the Sheriff did excite any to ſue theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33452:17"/> is ſaid without any ſhew of proof: Nor can the Aſſertion of a Perſon who hath written ſo many Lies in a few pages, induce any rational Perſon to believe it, <hi>page</hi> 19, 20. He offereth to <hi>prove all that he hath ſaid, and more, that he might alledge:</hi> Which we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him to do, as he would not bear the Infamy of that Lying and Slandering that he moſt unjuſtly chargeth the Presbyterians with, <hi>page</hi> 20. He claſſeth the perſecuted Clergy, into four Ranks: The three former I have taken notice of, in anſwer to the two Pamphlets above anſwered. Of the fourth, which is, ſuch as were put out by the Judicatories of the Church (which this mocker calleth <hi>the Holy Inquiſition of the Presbyterian Preachers</hi>) he giveth not one Inſtance. I deny not but ſome (and they were but very few) were depoſed, or ſuſpended, by ſome Presbyteries, for inſufficient cauſes: And it is no wonder that ſome Miniſters who were not well experienced in the practical part of Church Government, might commit ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: But this can no ways be charged on the Presbyterians, not only becauſe they were but very few that did ſo; but eſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> took ſpecial care, both to prevent this practice and to redreſs the grievances of ſuch as made complaint, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had been thus wrong'd. For in 1689. a general Meeting did enjoin all the Presbyteries to be careful that none of the late Conformiſts be cenſured except for Inſufficiency, Scandal, Errour, or ſupine Negligence in the Miniſterial Work; nor unleſs theſe were ſufficiently proved againſt them; and that if there ſhould be any doubt, either about the relevancy of what ſhould be Libelled againſt any of them, or about the clearneſs of the proof of what any of them ſhould be charged with in that caſe, they ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to a ſentence, but refer the matter to the General Aſſembly, which was to meet. This was what could be done by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution. And for relief of ſuch as pretended to be grieved; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſuch as were Cenſured by Presbyteries (moſt of them I mean, for ſome were ſo guilty in their own Eyes, and to the conviction of all that knew them; that they acquieſced in their Sentence) did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the General Aſſembly, the Aſſembly (not having time to do it) did appoint a Commiſſion of the graveſt, and moſt experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, of their number, conſiſting of 40 Miniſters and 20 Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to examine theſe proceſſes, and to take off ſuch Sentences as they ſhould find unduely paſſed againſt any Perſon.

What Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> ſuffered: In which we are little concerned; For himſelf ſaith that it was the Cameronians that gave him this trouble: only I take notice of his falſe and malicious ſurmiſing, <hi>That they lay in wait to Murder him:</hi> And of his wicked Inſinuation of <hi>Murders and Slaughters committed by that Helliſh Crew.</hi> All the Nation know that the work of that irregularly zealous party was to deprive thoſe Miniſters who had been their cruel Perſecutors from their Churches, and that none of them were ever Murdered by them. Let him bring Inſtances, and the full proof that he promiſeth, for what he moſt impudently obtrudeth on Peoples Credulity, and he ſhall have an Anſwer. Not only the men whom he accuſeth may be thus Vindicated in general, but the whole of the Story about Mr. <hi>Dowglas</hi> is a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery: I can ſhew (atteſted by the Subſcriptions of eighteen Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons of the Pariſh of <hi>Skirling</hi> with the Baily of the Town) a true account of Mr. <hi>Dowglas</hi>'s Caſe, which he and his Party may be aſhamed of: It is to this effect: Never any of the Diſſenters moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, or gave him the leaſt cauſe of fear: All that could be ſo conſtructed, even by the moſt melancholy Fancy, was; two Men, as they went by his door, ſtept in, and asked his Wife, if ſhe had any Monuments of Idolatry, and ſo went away. Never any of his Pariſh did either do, or threaten any hurt to him. The true cauſe of his flying into <hi>England</hi> was, he had run into ſo much Debt as he was not ſafe in the Nation from Captions; he had lived Intemperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Riotouſly: his Bible was laid in pledge for Ale; which lyeth yet unredeemed. His other Books were pledged in <hi>Biggar</hi> for Banquetting; his Wifes Bible pledged for <hi>Mutton;</hi> which ſhe redeemed before ſhe removed: His Houſholds Goods are under many Arreſtments. When he went from <hi>Skirling,</hi> he borrowed a Cloak from a Neighbour, and in the way to <hi>Edinburgh</hi> left the Cloak in pledge for a Quart of Ale: his Pariſh (tho Diſſenters) did often relieve his Wife in her Neceſſity, and what ſhe got that way, ſhe ſpent in Drinking with Souldiers and others. Let the Reader now judge whether that be a Perſecution like the <hi>French Dragooning.</hi> Our Authors complaint that no Redreſs was given by the State, to them who complained, is above anſwered, particularly the Letter alledged by him, to have been written by a great Perſon to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33452:18"/> of <hi>Bogie,</hi> which Letter was produced in the Council by the Duke of <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> this, I ſay, is cleared <hi>Sect.</hi> 15, Of the anſwer to <hi>Account of the preſent Sufferings.</hi> What follows <hi>p.</hi> 23. is a Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Epiſcopal Clergy from provoking the Presbyterians, or having any hand in their Perſecution in the late Reigns: Where one may obſerve the man to be <hi>perfrictae frontis:</hi> And that nothing, tho never ſo certainly, and manifeſtly falſe, can choak his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

And no Evidence could be brought that any in theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes were Acceſſory to theſe Acts. To theſe I add a fourth; Mr. <hi>Mackenzie</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Boyal,</hi> above-mentioned, went to the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Caſtle of <hi>Dumbartoun,</hi> and got Souldiers to go with him, and apprehended <hi>Robert Nairn</hi> in <hi>Napierſtoun</hi> (the Souldiers affirmed that he procured their being ſent:) This he did ſeveral times; ſo that the very day that the poor man died, they behoved to remove him to another Houſe; where he died, and Mr. <hi>Mackenzie</hi> would not ſuffer him to be buried in the Church-yard, and cauſed caſt out his Family: ſo that his Wife and ten Children were forced to Lodge ſeveral Weeks without doors in Froſt and Snow. What he ſaith <hi>page</hi> 24. doth not derogate from what I have aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> He affirmeth, that <hi>They were neither Judges nor Parties, nor Witneſſes, nor Accuſers:</hi> It is true they did not ordinarily appear ſo publickly againſt them before Civil Courts: Yet did they more privately aſſiſt in Military Execution againſt them; and that moſt frequently: And gave Intelligence to Juſtices of Peace, and others who had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33452:19"/> Power to Moleſt them. Nothing can be more falſe than to ſay, That <hi>When they were commanded by Authority to give in the Names of Diſſenters they generally declined it, till they were forced to it.</hi> For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one knoweth, that there were but few who ſhunned it: Moſt of them did forwardly obey this Injunction. Tho I confeſs there were ſome whom no Laws, nor Threats of Men, could prevail with to do a thing ſo unbecoming the Character of a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; but theſe were very few. He doth alſo aver, <hi>That no Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuffered purely for Diſſenting; but only in caſe of open Rebellion, or in the caſe of Murther: As for Killing the Archbiſhop of St.</hi> Andrews. This alſo is a notorious and ſhameful falſhood. Did not all the Presbyterian Miniſters ſuffer Deprivation of their Churches and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices (which he and his Party make ſuch outcry about when it is come to the turn of ſome of themſelves) purely for Diſſenting? Did they not ſuffer Baniſhment, ſome of them into Forreign Lands, others from their Dwellings, that they might not be within ſix Miles of their Pariſhes, or a Cathedral. So as hardly they could find a place in the Nation where they could reſide, without hazard from the Laws? Were not multitudes Fined, to the ruine of their Families, for not hearing their pariſh Miniſters, or for Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and what is this but pure Diſſenting? I hope it is neither open Rebellion, nor Murther. Was not the <hi>Highland Hoſt</hi> (a Crew of <hi>Savage Robbers</hi>) ſent into the <hi>Weſtern, Countries</hi> while the people were living in Peace: Who almoſt laid the Country deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and left no Suſtenance for Man nor Beaſt? Were not many Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolled, or Hanged, or Drowned, as they were found on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or about their Work, in their Houſes, or in the Fields, for no other Cauſe but they would not tell what were their Thoughts of the Inſurrection at <hi>Bothwel Bridge;</hi> or of the Archbiſhops Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while they could not be Accuſed for neither: Or for not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning the <hi>Sanquhar Declaration</hi> (when, may be, they knew not what it was) or for not diſowning the Covenant? And can ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be charged either with open Rebellion, or Murther? What Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, could find them Guilty of theſe Crimes? Among multitudes of Inſtances of this kind that can be brought (for it can be made appear that above Seventy were thus Murdered in Cold Blood, and without any Legal Trial) I ſhall mention but three for a <hi>Specimen.</hi> Some Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (whoſe Names, out of reſpect to them, I forbear to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) took two Women, <hi>Margaret Laughland</hi> and <hi>Margaret Wilſon,</hi> the one of 60, the other of 20 years; and cauſed them to be tyed to a Stake, within the Sea mark, at <hi>Wigtoun,</hi> and left them there till

He taketh occaſion, <hi>page</hi> 23, 24. to mention ſeveral perſons who are Murthered: As if all this had been done by Presbyterians: As the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> and others. But malice it ſelf cannot charge theſe Crimes on that party; ſome of which they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally lamented, becauſe done by Men who took that Name to themſelves: Tho' others of them were committed by Perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, as the Murther of Mr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> at <hi>Carsfairn:</hi> None in theſe parts can to this day tell who were the Actors in that Tragedy. Some of them by ſuch as were in a declared ſtate of War againſt the King, and all his Adherents, whoſe principles and practices we never approved; and who were Enemies to the Sober Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as well as to them whom they called Curates: Some alſo of theſe Murthers were committed on private pique, and for revenge of perſonal injuries done, or alledged to have been done. If it be true which he aſſerteth, <hi>page</hi> 25. That ſome of the Presbyterians ſince this late Revolution, have proved ungrateful to ſuch of the Clergy, as had done them Kindneſſes, when they were in Trouble, we are far from approving ſuch practices: Neither do we deny that ſome perſons are to be found amongſt us, who are not ſo good as they ſhould be. But that either the thing is true in the general, or that the inſtance that he bringeth is a Truth, we have little cauſe to believe on his Aſſertion. Nor do I think it worth the while to enquire into it.

But if he would prove this Aſſertion for his being confident to affirm it, it is but ſuitable to the whole ſtrain of his Book, and tho' ſtrange, is not rare. He muſt make it appear, that during the late Reigns, never any Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian was called Fanatick, Rebel, Seditious, (even while they lived peaceably) that never any Miniſter was charged with preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33452:20"/> Rebellion and Sedition, who yet either ſpoke nothing of the Differences of the Times; or taught Loyalty and Obedience in all things Lawful, even to ſuch Rulers as were of different principles from us. He muſt alſo demonſtrate, that no Presbyterians were Fined to the Ruin of their Families, for peaceable Hearing the Word, in a Houſe or in the Fields: Alſo he muſt ſhew that no Presbyterians were Impriſoned, Baniſhed, or carried Captive, and Sold as Slaves, for not hearing Epiſcopal Miniſters, or for Hearing Presbyterians; none of which he can prove: But we can make the contrary of all three evident; and ſhould be at the pains to do it, but that the whole Nation are Witneſſes to the Truth of all theſe.</p>

He cometh <hi>page</hi> 26. to a purpoſe (by what courſe he draweth it into his method, I know not) wherein there is ſome place for Argument: But I muſt the more eaſily diſpatch it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have debated that point in my <hi>former Vindication;</hi> in anſwer to the ten Queſtions. It is, he pretendeth to take off the force of a Conſideration that was in the Narrative of the Act of Parliament, whereby the Government of the Church was lately ſetled in the Hands of Presbyterians, <hi>viz. That the Reformation of this Church from Popery was managed by Presbyters.</hi> To this he ſeemeth to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer two things. 1. He denieth the Conſequence. <hi>Reply,</hi> I know not that ever any did make this the Conſequent; <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Church ſhould be Presbyterian; for he may know that Presbyterians fix the Government of the Church on a ſurer, and immutable bottom, <hi>viz.</hi> Divine Inſtitution: And do hold that whoever were the Reformers, the Church ought to be governed by the Presbyters Acting in a parity. Wherefore all his talk under this Head, is wide from the purpoſe. The true Deſign of mentioning Presbyters to have been our Reformers, is to ſhew that the Government of this Church hath been Presbyterian, even from the Infancy of Proteſtantiſm among us: They being Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who ſetled the Proteſtant Church, and managed the Affairs of it, from the beginning, and ever till unfaithful and ſelf-ſeeking Men, after a tract of time, got that way forcibly ſuppreſt, and Church Domination ſet up for ſome years. His enlargement on this his Anſwer is ſtuffed with Reproaches againſt the Reformation, and againſt the Presbyterians: I ſhall not rake into that Dunghil, for it ſmelleth rankly of a Temper not much inclined to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and of an imbittered Mind. His Citation out of <hi>Baſilicon Doron,</hi> I have clearly anſwered in the paper before-cited. His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:33452:20"/> that <hi>the Presbyterians engage Parents, when their Children are Baptized, to bring them up conform to the Covenant,</hi> is a groſs falſhood; it is not enjoyned, nor by one of many hundreds practiſed, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Covenant on ſuch occaſions. He ſpeaketh of <hi>Rules, and Prayers to purge</hi> England <hi>of Prelacy and Superſtition, as uſed alſo at Baptiſm,</hi> which I never was Witneſs to, nor heard that it was done by any in our Nation: But this Man pleaſeth himſelf with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he can deviſe, to expoſe the Presbyterians. He cometh, in the end of <hi>page</hi> 27. To another anſwer to that which he fancieth to be our Argument for Presbytery, <hi>viz.</hi> To deny the Antecedent of it; or that <hi>Scotland was Reformed by Presbyters.</hi> Here the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man giveth us a <hi>Specimen</hi> of his Argumentative Skill, which will not make any Man admire the Learning of his party, which they ſo much brag of, while their Champions do manage an Argument ſo ſillily. He asketh, <hi>Who Ordained theſe Presbyters? Whether Biſhops or not? Anſ.</hi> It is an Impertinent Queſtion: For if they were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained; the quality of the Ordainers maketh nothing to prove that they were no Presbyters, nor that the Reformation was not carried on by Presbyters. If the Deſign of his Queſtion be, to prove that they were not Ordained, and ſo had no power to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Church: I refer him for Anſwer, to the Learned <hi>Claude</hi>'s <hi>Hiſtorical Defence of the Reformation.</hi> Who proveth that every Chriſtian hath power to Reform himſelf; and that every Society of Chriſtians hath power to Reform themſelves, from all principles and ways that are contrary to the Word of God: And to ſet up Ordinances among themſelves that Chriſt hath Inſtituted, ſee <hi>part 2. c. 4. page 166.</hi> and <hi>part 4. cap. 1, 3, 4.</hi> The ſame is maintained by <hi>Calvin, Inſtit. lib. 4. c. 3. 4. Turrit. part 3. loc. 18. queſt. 25.</hi> But our preſent Debate needeth not that we ſhould puſh this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſo far as theſe Learned Authors do. He asketh, <hi>If they were not Ordained by Biſhops, where are the Miracles that they have wrought to prove their Miſſion.</hi> I ſhall not here alledge (as ſome have done, without being ever Anſwered by any of his party) that there were not wanting among our Reformers extraordinary Appearances of God with them, convincing the World of their being ſent of him. I ſhall firſt take notice of the concluſion of this Argument (if it have any force) which will be, that our Reformation was unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, as being carried on, <hi>A non habentibus poteſtatem.</hi> And it is pleaſant to obſerve, that this Author can brangle the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Intereſt, by no other Arguments, than ſuch as will, with equal force, ſhake our Reformation from Popery. 2. That Miracles are
<pb facs="tcp:33452:21"/> neceſſary to ſhew a Mans Miſſion, which is not communicated to him in the ordinary way, in reſpect of the Modes, and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, none do maintain but Papiſts, and ſuch as in too many things Symbolize with them. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and ſeveral of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, wrought no Miracles, and yet had an extraordinary Miſſion. It is only to be expected that they ſhould work Miracles, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be extraordinarily ſent, to preach a new Doctrine, or bring in a new Office into the Church which is not warranted in the Scripture. Next he will prove, <hi>That if they were Ordained by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, it cannot be called a pure Presbyterian Reformation:</hi> His reaſon for this is ſtrange, to drop from the Pen of a pretended Proteſtant. For (ſaith he) <hi>I ſuppoſe, which none deny, they were obliged to preach the Goſpel, as the Biſhop who conferred Orders on them, bound them thereunto.</hi> Whither will bold Ignorance carry one? Can none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this his Aſſertion? Do not all, except Papiſts, and a few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pizing Prelatiſts, deny it? If this were ſo, muſt we not condemn <hi>Luther,</hi> and all the Reformers, who preached the Goſpel otherwiſe than the Popiſh Biſhops, who conferred Orders on them, injoyned. The Inference that he ſubjoineth, is none of ours: We think our ſelves exempted from Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, and obliged to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh that Order; not becauſe the Goſpel was at firſt preached by Presbyters; but becauſe that Order hath no Foundation in the Word.</p>

               <p>§ 9. A Goodly Argument he hath, <hi>page</hi> 28. That <hi>Scotland</hi> was not Reformed by Presbyters: <hi>viz. Some Biſhops Reformed; as Dr.</hi> Gordon <hi>of</hi> Galloway, <hi>and</hi> Adam <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Orkney, he bringeth no proof for the former, but for the latter, <hi>he was Excommunicated for Marrying the Queen to the Earl of</hi> Bothwel; <hi>which had been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous, if he had not been of the Proteſtant Communion.

If theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops had any hand in the Reformation, it is nothing to his purpoſe, unleſs he can prove that they exerciſed Epiſcopal Juriſdiction in the Proteſtant Church; which no Hiſtory can Countenance; if they Acted as Church-men at all, they Acted as Presbyters, for it is certain, that in the beginning of our Reformation, none exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed

                  <hi>why they are Warmer here than in</hi> England, <hi>is,</hi> England <hi>was Reformed by the Royal Authority; and therefore their Church was ſuted to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: But</hi> Scotland <hi>was Reformed by Force and Violence, and ſome of the Reformers, coming from</hi> Geneva, <hi>and</hi> Switzerland, <hi>inſpired ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their Converts with an Averſion to Monarchy.</hi> A Man who tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Liberty to ſlander at this rate of Impudence, deſerveth rather Chaſtiſement, than an Anſwer. For, 1. With what Brow can he ſay that our Reformers were averſe from Monarchy; or that the Antimonarchical Principle did ever get much footing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as we know it did in <hi>England;</hi> for all their being Reformed by Royal Authority? Did ever <hi>Scotland</hi> ſet up a Commonwealth, as <hi>England</hi> once did? It is known what they Adventured and Suffered for the Monarchy, when <hi>England</hi> abjured it. And what yielding there was in <hi>Scotland</hi> to the Antimonarchical way, was by Force from <hi>England.</hi> And it is known to all who lived in thoſe days, that the Presbyterians did cleave more firmly to their baniſhed King, and prayed for him with more Conſtancy and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than that party did, who after appeared for Epiſcopacy. 2. <hi>That</hi> Scotland <hi>was Reformed by Force and Violence,</hi> is falſe, it was by the States of the Nation, and at laſt confirmed by King and Parliament. The chief difference, as to the Original of the two Reformations, lay in this; that in <hi>England,</hi> the King (whether from Light, or Intereſt I do not judge) begun a half Reformation: And Royal Authority enlightned the Minds of the people (I ſpeak not of all, but of the Multitude) but in <hi>Scotland,</hi> Light from the Word of God did move, firſt the People, then the Great Ones, and they prevailed with the King at laſt, Zealouſly to own the Truth of God: Yea, and to defend it in Print. 3. That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was ſuited to the Monarchy (that is, as I ſuppoſe he meaneth, framed by a ſuitableneſs to the Monarchy, as the Standard of it) is not its commendation: For that is to make it a humane Contrivance, or worldly Policy, brought into the Church of Chriſt, over which he is the Head; and which is to be governed by his Laws: Whereas the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> was contrived by the Word of God, as the Standard of it; yet was it as much ſuited to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy as that of <hi>England</hi> could be: That is, it gave, and giveth to the King, all that power in the State that our Laws gave him: And all that Authority over the Church that is due to any Man on Earth. The Abettors of it preach and practiſe as much Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Subjection to Kings, as others do, and can vie in Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:33452:23"/> with their Accuſers, as ſhall after be obſerved. 4. I do not underſtand how our preſent Animoſities, about Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould depend on the one way being ſuited to the Monarchy, and the other not, ſeeing this Author (as well as his oppoſites re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally are) doth highly pretend, to be not only for the Monarchy, but for the preſent Monarch King <hi>William.</hi> But either he hath a latent Meaning, which hath much Truth in it, or he hath hit on the Truth by gueſs, as <hi>Cajaphas</hi> did, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Animoſities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Church Government ariſe mainly from the different Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the two parties toward the Monarchy, as now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Perſons of our Gracious King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> The ſtrain, both of their Writings and Actings, make it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that with him the Intereſt of King <hi>James,</hi> and that of Prelacy are linked together: And their Zeal for the one filleth them with Spite and Animoſity againſt what is oppoſite to the other. And whoſo conſidereth the ſtrain of this Pamphlet, will find that the Zeal that this Scribler pretendeth to for King <hi>William,</hi> is expreſſed uſually under the general Notion of the Monarchy; which may be underſtood of either of two Monarchies. What he ſaith, that, Buchannan, <hi>and others, wrote Books that were condemned for Treaſon,</hi> is no Argument: For that which by one party is condemned for Treaſon, by another party, when they have got the Aſcendent, hath been abſolved, as not guilty of that Crime. That the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans vexed King</hi> James VI. is no further true than that they could not yield to the endeavours of ſome evil Counſellers about him, for overturning the Setled Government of the Church; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching on its Rights. It is true, <hi>He at laſt got Epiſcopacy ſetled by the help of ſome, both in State and Church,</hi> who were either none of the beſt Proteſtants, or had their worldly Deſigns in promoting that way; but ſtill our Author owneth (on the matter) that the Word of God was not conſulted in this weighty Concernment of the Church: But only his fancied <hi>ſuitableneſs to the Monarchy, and Conformity to</hi> England. The account he giveth of putting down Epiſcopacy afterwards, and ſetting up of Presbytery, is neither like a Chriſtian, nor like a Hiſtorian: It is perfect railing, while, he calleth the <hi>Nobles,</hi> that had a hand in it, <hi>Ambitious and Factious,</hi> the Gentry <hi>Prieſt-ridden, and blind Zealots, the Preachers Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticks.</hi> The War that he mentioneth, is by all Poſterity to be lamented, but Men as able to diſcern as he, have laid the blame of it on Epiſcopal Tyranny and Uſurpation, and their making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſteps toward Popiſh Doctrine, as well as Diſcipline. He next
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:33452:23"/> giveth account of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant entered into with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Royal Authority, calling Parliaments, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe things were done by the Body of the Nation, met in the moſt orderly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative that the time and caſe could permit: And I deny not, but that they were extraordinary Actings, not to conſider now the Morality of them. But let this Gentleman freely tell us, whether his Epiſcopal party be capable of Courſes parallel to theſe which he ſo expoſeth: The Presbyterians under the conduct of the <hi>Primores Regni,</hi> aroſe againſt their King, in defence of their Religion and Laws; did not the Prelatick party the ſame, and on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? They were indeed all for Loyalty and Non-reſiſtance, while the Royal Authority ſupported their greatneſs and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Brethren, but when ſeven of their Biſhops were touched, it proved another caſe, like that in <hi>Ployden,</hi> if we be guilty in this, they are not the Men who ſhould <hi>caſt the firſt Stone at us.</hi> For Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities committed by the Presbyterians in theſe times, I know of none, but what are the neceſſary conſequents of a War. But this Man and his Aſſociates, have no other Dialect, whereby to expreſs their diſlike of the Actings of the oppoſite party. He accuſeth them with a Bloody Mouth, of what hath been a thouſand times refuted as a horrid Lie, <hi>That the Scots Presbyterians did perſidiouſly give up their King to the Engliſh, who Murdered him:</hi> He was the King of the Engliſh, as well as theirs, and they could not withhold him from them: And gave him into their hands, on as good ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as could be, for his ſafety; and if others dealt perfidiouſly with him they are not to be blamed for it. He hath a hint, as if <hi>Epiſcopacy had been ſetled by King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second, becauſe the Presbyterians refuſed all conditions of peace and pardon: And for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies ſake.</hi> The former of theſe is a great untruth; they never refuſed peace nor pardon; but would gladly have imbraced both: Only they could not buy them at the rate of Perjury: Tho' they never refuſed to diſown any Principles that were indeed Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Their <hi>preaching up Rebellion in their Conventicles,</hi> is falſe: They both preached and practiſed Loyalty: Only after many grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and inſupportable hardſhips, ſuffered for their Conſcience, ſome few of them were prevailed upon by that Temptation, to vent ſome Principles that the more Sober and Intelligent were not ſatisfied with. <hi>That puniſhing them who were taken in Rebellion is all the ſeverity complained of,</hi> is a Notorious Falſhood, as all the Nation know, and I have above diſproved it.</p>

               <p>§ 3. From theſe ſo well laid Foundations, he proceedeth, <hi>p.</hi> 5. to give His Highneſs ſome Advices; if they may not more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called Directions. The firſt, <hi>That the Prince being come to ſupport our Laws, is in Honour bound to ſupport Epiſcopacy, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by twenty Parliaments.</hi> This is Saucy enough: As if His Majeſty had Acted againſt his Honour now that Epiſcopacy is not ſupported. That Epiſcopacy is confirmed by ſo many Parliaments, I much doubt: But am not at leiſure to caſt up the account. But if this Argument be good, Presbytery ſhould be ſupported, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confirmed by many Parliaments; and now by this Current Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Beſides its Authority from Scripture, which he doth not pretend to for Prelacy. His ſecond Inference from his Hiſtorical Narrative (or rather Railing Accuſation) is, <hi>That Epiſcopacy is neceſſary for ſupport of the Government: And that they oppoſe Scots Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, only as it hath in it many horrid Principles.</hi> Both theſe are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and cannot be proved, unleſs we take malicious railing for proof. His 3<hi>d.</hi> That <hi>what the late Rulers did was done by Law: And that theſe Laws were made for preſerving the Proteſtant Religion, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Humane Society, and Self Defence.</hi> It is an eaſie thing to make Sanguinary Laws, and then Murder and Deſtroy Mankind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe Laws: But I have ſhewed in my <hi>former Vindication,</hi> in anſwer to <hi>Query</hi> 5. That they exceeded the bounds, even of their own Laws: In the Horrid Murthers that were, in cold Blood, committed by Souldiers, with allowance, on Perſons living in peace. But that theſe Laws were made on ſuch neceſſary grounds as he affirmeth, is an Aſſertion beyond what Jeſuitical impudence it ſelf, hath as yet arrived at: But I ſhall not wonder, if he ſhould aſſert, that the world could not ſubſiſt, except Laws be made for extirpating out of it, all who own the Chriſtian Religion. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the Proteſtant Religion, Monarchy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ſafe unleſs People be forced to wound their Conſciences by hearing men who had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the Pulpits of their Faithful Paſtors? Unleſs Families be ruined who live in peace, and pray for their Rulers, who hear a Sermon in a Chamber, and not in the Church? He affirmeth alſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head, that <hi>we value our Church Government more than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion.</hi> A moſt falſe Imputation: But he proveth it, by three notable Lies: One is, <hi>That we complied with the Papiſts, upon getting an Indulgence.</hi> We neither ſought it, nor approved the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts being Indulged, nor did we join with them in any thing: We indeed had our Meetings at the ſame time when they had theirs, and ſo had the Epiſcopal men. The other is, <hi>the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:33452:24"/> 
                  <hi>and their Party, hazarded all rather than comply,</hi> I gladly would know, wherein did we comply, and they did not. They had the exerciſe of their Religion under the ſame Government with us. A third is, <hi>We magnifie the diſpenſing power, which they oppoſed.</hi> All this I have touched before. This Aſſertion is falſe and injurious: We never approved it, we made uſe of the Liberty granted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was our due: But never approved of the power that the Giver of it did acclaim. How they oppoſed it, may be judged by conſidering whether the Contrivers and Promoters of theſe courſes, who were about the King, were Presbyterians or Prelatiſts.</p>

               <p>§ 4. The fourth thing (he is now falling from his Inferences and Counſels to the King, to proofs of his Accuſations againſt the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians) that <hi>their Principles prove what he would ſay:</hi> And their Principles he proveth in that <hi>he is informed that many of them own, that Subjects may force their King to do juſtice; that they are his Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and may Dethrone him: that they approve of former Rebellions that the Monarch being forfeited, Kings have no more Power than the People will give them.</hi> I obſerve firſt, That all the Grounds that he hath for theſe Accuſations, is, <hi>He hath heard it,</hi> but from whom, or what cauſe his Informers had to ſay ſo, we muſt not know. If this be a ſufficient Ground to move a Prince againſt his People (as this man deſigneth) let any Judge. 2. That he, and they who have whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this to him, do not impute thoſe to the Presbyterians, as the Principles of the Party; but to many of them: And no body know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how many. It may be there are, or have been, ſome who call themſelves Presbyterians, who hold theſe, or as bad things: But the Presbyterians did never approve of all that had gone from among them. 3. What he ſaith about forfeiting of the Monarchy (tho I do not meddle with things ſo far above me) hath obtained with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as <hi>Scotland.</hi> And his quarrelling at this, hath a further tendency againſt the preſent Eſtabliſhment, than may be he is willing that every one ſhould obſerve. His fifth effort againſt us is, He taketh notice of <hi>Peoples threatning Miniſters</hi> (he addeth alſo, <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> which I never heard of before) <hi>and thruſting them from their places.</hi> This was the practice of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in ſome places, I have in anſwer to the above mentioned Pamphlets, ſufficiently vindicated the Presbyterians, both from abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and from approving of theſe practices: And therefore they ought not to be charged with them. In the ſixth place he would perſwade the Prince, <hi>that our numbers are not ſo great as theirs,</hi> this I have alſo above Diſcourſed, but I ſhall a little conſider his proofs;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:33452:25"/> one is, 27 <hi>Parliaments under four Kings, have condemned Presbytery. Anſ.</hi> If that prove, that they were the greateſt number, the like Argument will prove, that we are more numerous now: For the Parliament hath very unanimouſly condemned their way. Next he will prove it, becauſe <hi>they were always eaſily overcome in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions.</hi> Sure it was not ſo in King <hi>Charles</hi> the I. time: And in King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. time it was not the Presbyterians, but a few of them, that appeared. He ſaith that <hi>the reaſon why they appear more numerous here</hi> (at <hi>London,</hi> 1689) <hi>is they are all here:</hi> That is manifeſtly falſe: neither all the Nobility, nor the Tenth man of the Gentry, beſide the Vulgar, who are the greateſt number, were then at <hi>London.</hi> His judging of their deſigns of being there, is his groundleſs Fancy; ſuggeſted by his hatred and ill will. His party (forſooth) are ſo modeſt <hi>that they truſted to the Laws, the intereſt of the Monarchy, and his Highneſſes juſt ſenſe of things:</hi> But others thought that they truſted more to King <hi>James</hi>'s Intereſt, and were more moved by their averſion from his Highneſs: Let the Reader judge whether of the two conjectures hath the more probable Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. He alledgeth, that <hi>the Presbyterians have raiſed tumults to fright Honeſtmen.</hi> This is denied, his party raiſed (<hi>or endeavoured it at leaſt</hi>) more fearful Tumults. And hence he would move the Prince, <hi>to ſend down Forces, under well Principled Officers.</hi> That is, <hi>Jacobites:</hi> But the Prince was wiſer than to Liſten to ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>

            <div n="5" type="section">
               <p>§. 5. He next would repreſent us as <hi>Perſons who would ſubmit to no Laws inconſiſtent with Presbytery; on the account of the Divine right of Presbytery, and our obligation to it by Oaths: Whereas his Party are readier to comply with any thing that his Highneſs and a Parliament ſhall think fit, for the good of the Kingdom,</hi> and ſo pleadeth for a <hi>hearing before his Highneſs, or any to be named by Him.</hi> This laſt we ſhall never decline. On the former part of this Paragraph, I make a few Remarks. 1. If he mean that we cannot ſo ſubmit to Laws in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Presbytery, as to give active Obedience to them, or that we ſhould do what is inconſiſtent with it; he maketh a right conjecture: But it importeth no more than this, that we Act by a Principle, and are not ſo Unconſcientious as to do what is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Sentiments; if other men glory either in their having no Principle, in the matter of Church Government, or that they can yield over the Belly of Conſcience, to promote their Intereſt, or to gain the favour of Men; we think <hi>ſuch Glorying is not good.</hi> But if he mean that we cannot ſo ſubmit to Laws contrary to Presbytery,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33452:25"/> as to live quietly under them: To ſuffer patiently by them, when we cannot obey them. It is a manifeſt ſlander: For we gave ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof of that, under the late Reigns: And if any were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet under their ſufferings, the reſt, who were the far greateſt part, are not to be blamed. 2. Our Author, and his Party, have very generous Conſciences, which it ſeemeth are influenced by no other Law but the King and Parliaments Opinion, that ſuch a thing is for the good of the Monarchy and the Kingdom: Men of ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can eaſily ſave their Intereſt, what ever ſide be uppermoſt. 3. Seeing they pretend to ſo ſupple Conſciences, I fain would know why they do not comply with Presbytery; ſeeing now the King and Parliament have owned, and enacted it, as that which is for the good of the Monarchy, and the Kingdom. Here is a plain declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that thoſe men can have no plea for a Toleration to be granted them, or any Exemption from the Government now by Law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; for their Conſciences cannot be ſtraitned in this matter: And therefore there can be no Imaginable reaſon for a Toleration; But either Humour, or a deſign to carry on an Intereſt contrary to the preſent Eſtabliſhment: which I hope our Rulers will conſider. 4<hi>ly.</hi> He argueth with his Highneſs, from <hi>The averſion that</hi> England <hi>muſt have to unite with</hi> Scotland, <hi>if Presbytery be ſet up there.</hi> To this I anſwer two things. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> If the intereſt of Religion have more weight with us than that of the State (as ſurely it will when that promiſe is fulfilled, that <hi>the Mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be ſet on the top of the Mountains</hi>) this reaſon will be of no force: It is better that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> be two different Nations, yet living as Siſters, in concord; than that the Inſtitutions of Chriſt ſhould be thwarted, that they be made one. 2<hi>dly.</hi> It may be thought ſtrange, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhould refuſe to unite with <hi>Scotland</hi> in their Civil concernment, becauſe <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot yield to them in that which concerneth God, and their Conſciences: may not two Nations trade together, and be Governed by the ſame Laws, and yet bear with one another as to their Church ways? But he enforceth this his Argument, by two conſiderations; one is, <hi>Epiſcopacy is acknowledged to be the beſt Bulwark againſt Popery.</hi> I know this is the Fancy of ſome, who are Bigotted to that way, but on what ground, or who acknowledgeth this, beſide themſelves I know not. The other is, <hi>Scotland is Sworn by the Covenant, to extirpate Epiſcopacy in</hi> England. <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Covenant obligeth to no ſuch thing, unleſs <hi>England</hi> call them to their Aſſiſtance. The Covenant ſetteth Limits to mens Actings, by their Station: If <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould meddle with <hi>Englands</hi> Church

If Prelacy be extirpated by a Law, and Presbytery be by Law eſtabliſhed (as through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God now it is) cannot Presbyterians be ſubject to that Law? And I have already ſhewed, how we can be ſubject even to other Laws. It is alſo an unaccountable Inference, that <hi>the Covenant</hi> (which he moſt wickedly reproacheth) <hi>muſt be the Rule, if Presbytery be ſettled:</hi> He may know that Presbyterians have no other Rule in their Church Adminiſtrations, than the Scripture. And if any thing in the Covenant can be made appear contrary to that, they are ready to diſown it. For what he ſaith of our Addreſs, it ſhall be after conſidered. The laſt thing that he repreſenteth to the Prince is, That <hi>the difference betwixt the Epiſcopal men in</hi> Scotland, <hi>and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, is but ſmall: They having neither Liturgy nor Ceremonies, more than the Presbyterians have.</hi> We are not for widening the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but would bring it to as narrow a compaſs as may be. Yet we muſt not tell untruths (as this Author doth) to deceive them who know not our affairs; by repreſenting Agreement, where really it is not. For the difference betwixt us and them is irreconcileable, without the yielding of one Party, while they are for the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one Miniſter over the reſt, and we are for a Parity among them. He ſaith, <hi>Their Biſhops are in the place of our Moderators; whom we have ſometimes confeſſed may be conſtant. Anſ.</hi> This we cannot yield: Our Moderator hath no Juriſdiction, yea no Vote; unleſs where there is an equality. The Biſhop hath a negative Vote. For our Moderator being conſtant, it is contrary to our practice, yea our Opinion is, that whatever Lawfulneſs be in it, it is ſo highly inexpedient, that we can never yield to it. He ſaith, <hi>the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have a free Vote in the Biſhops Election.</hi> Nothing can be more falſe. Is not the Biſhop named by the King? And was it ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that the Perſon whom the King had named ſhould be paſſed by and another choſen? where is then the freedom of Vote? He
<pb facs="tcp:33452:26"/> ſaith, <hi>the Biſhops Govern only by Presbyteries and Synods:</hi> The contrary is known to every one: The Biſhop taketh their Counſel when he pleaſeth, not elſe. The grounds for complaint and ſeparation from them (ſuch as we made) I have above diſcourſed.</p>

On moſt paſſages of it he hath ſome quibling obſerves, more like a Bouffoon than a Diſputant. If the paper were ours, I ſhould not think his reparties worthy of an anſwer: They are ſo purely, either trifling or railing: but the beſt of it is, he hath pickt up a paper, to which either he, or ſome Body elſe, hath given that Title: But it is none of ours, nor was it agreed to by the Presbyterians, or preſented to his Highneſs. We did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed preſent an Addreſs, if he hath any thing to ſay againſt that, we ſhall conſider the ſtrength of what he ſhall ſay: But for this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it is not only not our Addreſs, but hardly can two papers aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame thing, and on the ſame ſubject, have leſs agreement in matter, or words, than it hath with our Addreſs.

For the third, We do not abhor the Communion of any of the Churches abroad, in their Adminiſtrating the Ordinances of Chriſt: But we know that ſome Reformed Churches have practices that we cannot approve; and in theſe practices we can have no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them.

Yet it was allowed by by the State, and determined by the Church, that as many of the Epiſcopal men as were qualified to be Miniſters, and would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to concur with, and act nothing againſt Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould be received into a ſhare of the Government: And ſuch as had Miniſterial qualifications ſhould enjoy their places and benefices, tho they ſhould not ſo far own Presbytery as hath been mentioned. What is then the injury that he complaineth of, done to the Epiſcopal Clergy? None of them are deprived of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yea none excluded from Miniſterial Communion, but of their own choice; that they will not ſubmit to terms ſo reaſonable, and neceſſary. They would have thought us (in the former Reigns) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unreaſonable, if we had been ſuffered to enjoy our Churches and Stipends, if we were not Drunkards or Swearers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of hard uſage; or if we ſhould have demanded a ſhare in Governing the Epiſcopal Church, and yet would not ſubmit to the Biſhop.

The Stipend is a Civil thing: but a mans Right to it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon his being in the Office, and having the Charge of ſuch a People: But it was never dreamed that a man ſhould be protected to continue a Miniſter, tho he be Ignorant, Scandalous, Erroneous, or ſupinely Negligent.

               <p>§ 3. He cometh now, <hi>page</hi> 3. to reaſon the Caſe againſt the King and Parliament, becauſe of their ſetling the Government of the Church in the Hands of Presbyterians. What is Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in his Diſcourſe I ſhall conſider: Neglecting the railing that he intermixeth with it, ſuch as, <hi>A Presbyterian Tyranny is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: That they,</hi> the Presbyterians, <hi>Lord it over their Brethren, more than ever the Biſhops did, or pretended to do:</hi> His Reaſons, ſo far as I can pick them out of his looſe Diſcourſe; are firſt, <hi>inſtead of fourteen Biſhops now ſixty are ſet up;</hi> by which he intendeth, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Government of the Church was now ſetled in ſo few Hands as ſixty. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The falſhood of this is manifeſt: The Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly conſiſted of an hundred and ſixteen Miniſters, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven Ruling Elders; and they were but Delegates from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Presbyteries, in which there were ordinarily a greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ſent them, than they that were ſent. Now the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not (by the Act of Parliament) ſetled in the perſons of Miniſters only, but of Ruling Elders alſo: Many of whom are No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and Gentlemen of good Abilities: Neither can it be ſaid, that they were ſet up as Biſhops; or acted with their Lordly do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, as will appear from anſwering his following Objections. He next ſaith, <hi>Presbyters were ſubject to them who were no more but Presbyters; which hath no Preſident in the Catholick Church. Anſ.</hi> It is true, it is not preſidented in the Catholick Church, that one, or more Presbyters, ſhould be ſubject to one who is no more but a Presbyter; which is not our Conſtitution nor practice: But it hath often been, that Presbyters in their ſingle Capacity, were ſubject to them who were no more but Presbyters, acting jointly, in a Church Judicatory; and this is all that is now done. The Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church doth not ſubject the Epiſcopal Church to them: Nor doth one Presbyter among us judge one Presbyter among them: But the Presbyterian Church combined, judgeth every ſingle Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter in this National Church. And when he ſhall demonſtrate the Abſurdity of that, we ſhall yield to his Argument. Again, he argueth thus, <hi>They who could not be denyed to be lawful Miniſters were excluded from any ſhare in the Diſcipline and Government of the Church;</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:33452:29"/> 
                  <hi>which is contrary to Presbyterian Principles. Anſ.</hi> The Presbyterians never held a Principle, ſo univerſal as what he hinteth, about the priviledge of Lawful Miniſters to govern the Church: They never held that a Popiſh Miniſter ſhould be a Ruler in the Proteſtant Church: And they deny not ſuch to be lawful Miniſters: They maintain, that though it belong to all Miniſters generally, to have a ſhare in the Government of the Church; yet there might be ſome Caſes in which (<hi>pro praeſenti Eccleſiae Statu</hi>) they may be reſtrained from that priviledge: Tho' they are not to be reſtrained perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor in the ſetled State of the Church. The Presbyterian Church had long been born down, and almoſt exhauſted; they are now, through the Mercy of God, reſtored; they find a great many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in Charges, who may be uſeful in preaching the Goſpel, but diſpoſed to overturn the Government of the Church, if it ſhould be put in their Hands; is it not rational, that they ſhould ſuffer theſe to preach, for the Church needeth their help: And yet not ſuffer them to rule the Church, leſt they overturn her Settlement? They refuſe none of them who will ſecure the Government, and are otherwiſe qualified for the Miniſtry. Again, tho' we own them as lawful Miniſters; yet we cannot own them as Miniſters of the Presbyterian Church: They have a right to govern the Epiſcopal Church, to which they had betaken themſelves, and left the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Church (tho' their Biſhops, even in it, did not allow them that priviledge) yet that they have a right to rule the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Church we deny. They and we agree in Doctrine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may teach the Church together: But we diſagree in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and therefore we cannot rule together. He ſaith, <hi>That Presbyterians hold, that it is unlawful for a Miniſter to part with his Right of Governing. Anſ.</hi> But the Church may deny him the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of that priviledge, if ſhe find him inhabile for the exerciſe of it. He pleadeth alſo, <hi>That we blamed Biſhops that they took this Power generally to themſelves. Anſ.</hi> We did ſo, becauſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the reſt; not on account of any ſpecial inhability, but as having no right to ſuch a power, which we maintain to be in all Presbyters alike. If any ſay, that Miniſterial power is <hi>quid indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum,</hi> and the exerciſe of teaching cannot be allowed, where that of Ruling power is reſtrained: I anſwer, this is true with reſpect to the ordinary and ſetled State of the Church; but ſuch an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſe of neceſſity as this may warrant ſuch a reſtraint for a time. But if this Argument hath any force, it proveth that neither Preaching nor Ruling ſhould be allowed: and it commendeth the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:33452:30"/> moderation of the Presbyterian Church, which will allow them to ſerve the Lord as they can, when they cannot do it as they ſhould.</p>

One is, <hi>We could not otherwiſe make our Government ſure.</hi> And is it not reaſonable that that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Chriſt hath ſetled in his Church (as we think) and which the Authority of the Nation hath ſetled, ſhould not be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred unſafe, by putting it in the hands of the avowed Enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; when we could exclude them on ſuch rational grounds as have have been mentioned. Another Argument he maintaineth as ours, <hi>The Epiſcopal Men deſerved to be thus treated, for their Apoſtaſie. Anſ.</hi> I know not who ever brought this Argument: We go not to the rigour of all the Cenſure, that that wrong ſtep deſerved; we would rather conſider what the preſent ſtate of the Church, and the promoting of Truth and Holineſs, and Unity, doth require; than what Men deſerve. We are for moderation, maugre all the reproaches that he, and ſuch as he caſt upon us: Tho' at the ſame time, we think that the Rigour of Church Diſcipline might put more force in this Argument than he is aware of. He inferreth from what he had diſcourſed, <hi>That Presbyterians juggle with God and Man; becauſe they hold their Government to be ſo of Divine Right, that they can make no compoſition with Men about it; but when it maketh for the Intereſt, they can make Eſſential Alterations. Anſ.</hi> We hold Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be of Divine Right, and cannot yield to Imparity: But this Parity is not taken away (as he alledgeth) by excluding them who have rendred themſelves inhabile; more than it is taken away by ſuſpending a Miniſter for any Immorality, or Negligence in his Work. Neither is there here any eſſential alteration in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, more than there is in that Caſe. Here is no Jugling, but fair and plain dealing. What he talketh of nine hundred Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters excluded, is a miſtake. We exclude none of them, but ſuch as perſiſt in their Principles, and Inclinations, to overturn the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Neither is there Inconſiſtency</hi> (as he would make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) <hi>between making Ruling Power Eſſential to a Miniſter, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpending the exerciſe of it for a time.</hi> We hold, that Rationality is eſſential to a Man, tho' ſome Scriblers be now and then Delirous.</p>

And giveth an account of the meeting of the Miniſters and Elders, antecedent to the General Aſſembly, indicted by the King and Parliament, to be held <hi>October</hi> 16. 1690. In which Narrative, he doth in ſeveral things, miſ-inform his Readers, and repreſent things
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:33452:30"/> to the diſadvantage of truth, and of the Presbyterians. It is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, <hi>That the Act of Parliament Committed the Care and Management of the Government to theſe few ſurviving Presbyterian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters who had not complyed with Epiſcopacy.</hi> For it was to them, and the Elders, and ſuch Miniſters and Elders as they had received, or ſhould receive. Another miſtake is, <hi>That the Meeting that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded the forementioned Aſſembly was called, to lay down methods how a General Aſſembly ſhould be called, and conſtituted, becauſe one could not be had, according to their minds, after the old manner, and ſtanding Rules of General Aſſemblies. Anſ.</hi> This Meeting was not called for that end, nor did act any thing to that purpoſe, nor needed they do ſo: For the Act of Parliament had excluded all the Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters from ſitting in the General Aſſembly, unleſs they were taken in by the Presbyterians. All that they did, that could any way concern the Conſtitution of the Aſſembly, was, that Presbyteries ſhould ſend three, or four of their number to the Aſſembly, where they had ſent but two, when there were more Miniſters in each Presbytery; which could no way alter the Conſtitution of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. He giveth a falſe account of the Act of Parliament, by which Presbyterian Government was ſetled; when he ſaith, <hi>That by it none had a ſhare of the Government, but ſuch Miniſters as had been removed by the reſtoration of Epiſcopacy.</hi> For both Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are expreſly mentioned, and ſuch Miniſters as the Presbyterians had received, or ſhould receive. Hence followeth another miſtake; viz. <hi>That they were over-ſeen when they admitted others into the Government, and were by that means over-voted.</hi> None were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but ſuch as the Act of Parliament reached; nor was there any over-voting in the Caſe; for both they who had been turned out by the Biſhops, and they who were after taken in, did general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree in the ſame Votes. He would revive the old forgotten, and Fatal Diviſion, that rent and ruined this Church, about the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation and Remonſtrance:</hi> But, through the Mercy of God, it is not ſo much as mentioned among us. That ſome of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators, who had been, under that woful Schiſm in the Church, depoſed by the oppoſite party, ſate among us, is true; and we know no reaſon why it ſhould not be ſo; for their Sentences were taken off, long before: And what was moved, and done in that meeting was, that the revoking of theſe Sentences ſhould be now confirmed by this Meeting, as being of more extenſive Authority than theſe which had recalled them. That any <hi>of them who ſate there, were depoſed for ſcandalous and groſs Crimes:</hi> Or for any thing but their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:33452:31"/> Opinion in that controverted point, and their practice according to it; is more than we know, and unleſs he can make it appear, he ought to be reputed a Slanderer; if he or any elſe ſhall prove it, we ſhall acknowledge our Errour, at leaſt our Ignorance, and ſhall rectifie what we have done amiſs. What he ſaith of Mr. <hi>Pitcairn</hi>'s <hi>proteſting againſt their ſitting there,</hi> is a groſs miſtake: That Reverend Brother was diſſatisfied with the way of wording the Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Meeting in that Affair, which ſome propoſed; and was a little hot about it; but he was ſoon ſatisfied: Neither did he enter any Proteſtation; tho' he ſpoke of it: Nor did he object againſt the recalling of their Sentences.

Which he doth yet more in what followeth, he telleth us of a <hi>Debate betwixt the old and the young Men, which of the two ſhould Rule.</hi> A Controverſie that never was ſo much as named in any of our meetings, nor for what I know in private Diſcourſe. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more falſe than the ſtory that he telleth; for inſtance in this matter, of a <hi>Conteſt between Mr.</hi> Rule <hi>and Mr.</hi> Webſter. No ſuch words were ever ſpoken: And if they had, there had been no truth in them. For what he talketh (in his Marginal Note) of <hi>the Contribution of the Siſters,</hi> ſavoureth more of Spite than Wit. Some of the Nonconformiſts lived on their own Eſtates, others by their Induſtry in Lawful Callings, yet diligently preaching the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, others by the Charity of good Women, and good Men too; as our Lord and his Apoſtles did: And his own party are now brought to that Mortification, that I ſuppoſe the <hi>Contributions of the Siſters</hi> are not deſpiſed by them. He quarrelleth with the Name of the <hi>General Meeting</hi> that preceded the Aſſembly, as being none of the Names of the Church Judicatories known ſince the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What if we ſhould ſay, it was an extraordinary Meeting, ſuch as that extraordinary Caſe of the Church did allow: And yet it wanted not Authority neither from God, it being made up of the Officers that Chriſt hath appointed to Rule his Church: Nor from Man, we have then a Liberty granted fot the exerciſe of our Miniſtry, in all the parts of it. We may alſo defend it to be a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly of this Presbyterian Church; which differed in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from that which followed, but that the one had the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the King and Parliament; this other only that of the King directly, and of the Parliament indirectly: The Parliament hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed the King a power of granting Indulgence to Diſſenters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33452:31"/> his account of the Work done by this meeting, he doth groſly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate, while he ſaith, <hi>They preſcribed Rules for trying Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Miniſters.</hi> They did indeed ſuppoſe that Presbyteries have an Intrinſick power of judging the Life and Doctrine of all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters within their bounds, and of excluding the unfit, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that are qualified; but conſidering the preſent paucity of Presbyterian Miniſters (which yet was not ſuch as he would have us believe.) They were ſo far from directing them to try theſe men, that they did wiſely caution them, and ſome way reſtrain them, in this Tryal: For their appointment was, that if, in trying theſe men, the Presbyteries ſhould meet with any Libel the Relevancy of which was doubtful, or if the ſufficiency of the proof were not clear; in ſuch Caſes they ſhould not proceed to a Sentence, but refer the Caſe to the General Aſſembly; which was ſoon after to ſit. What could they do more to prevent Injury to theſe Men; without denying that power of Presbyteries which is their due? He inſtanceth in ſome Presbyteries where were very few Miniſters; we deny it not; but that was but in ſome few places, and at firſt: There are more now, even in theſe places; and in other parts of the Countrey there were even then a competent number in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in ſome places few or none wanting: As in all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries of the Synod of <hi>Glaſgow.</hi> That there were ſo few, is not to be wondered at: The whole Nation being but t'other day under Epiſcopacy: The Youth having been generally ſo bred; and the Presbyterians being almoſt worn out by a long tract of time, and heavy Perſecution. There were fewer Proteſtant Miniſters in the beginning of the Reformation from Popery, and yet it was not thought fit that either the Church ſhould be without all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that it ſhould be put into the hands of Popiſh Prieſts while they continued ſuch. He is alſo diſpleaſed with <hi>appointing greater Presbyteries to ſend more Miniſters; as being an unequal Repreſentation of the Church.</hi> Others will think that this was moſt equal: For the General Aſſembly is the Repreſentative of the Presbyteries immediately (tho' more remotely they repreſent the whole Church.) And therefore where Presbyteries are unequal, their Repreſentation ſhould be ſo too. But <hi>by this means ſome part of the Nation were not at all repreſented. Anſ.</hi> It could not be otherwiſe, where there were no Presbyterian Miniſters; that place of the Church could not be repreſented by Epiſcopalians; for they neither had by Law, nor could claim in Reaſon, a ſhare of the Presbyterian Government: Neither can this Argument dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33452:32"/> from the Authority of the General Aſſembly over the whole Church; more than the vacancy of a Pariſh can warrant them to plead exemption from the power of the Presbytery, becauſe they have not a Miniſter to repreſent them in it.</p>

               <p>7. The next fault that he findeth is, <hi>The Meeting appointed a Faſt on the Lords Day;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>That it was the Cuſtom of the Old Presbyterians to appoint all their Faſts on the Lords Day.</hi> This laſt is notoriouſly falſe. The reaſon why that Faſt was on the Lords Day, it was the time of Harveſt, when it could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on a Week day, without high Inconveniency: Neither do we think Faſting inconſiſtent with the Nature of the Lords Day, Religious Joy and Religious Sorrow do very well agree. His ſtory about <hi>the Licenſing the Treatiſe of Ruling Elders and Deacons,</hi> is a groſs Calumny; and hath ſeveral Lies in it. 1. The Licenſing of that Book was not the deed of the Meeting, but of the Clerk, without their appointment or knowledge: And he alſo alledged, that the Printer added the words which imported a Monopoly of it. As ſoon as the Book came out, the Meeting were highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Clerk for this preſumption; not only becauſe he had done it in their Name, without their appointment; but becauſe (as was ſaid publickly in the Meeting, <hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi>) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the State to Licenſe Books, and to Monopolize the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. For this the Clerk was ſeverely rebuked, and hardly eſcaped being depoſed. 2. <hi>That the Privy Council checkt this, or called in the Books,</hi> is falſe: For their Lordſhips underſtood that it was not the deed of the Meeting; and that the Meeting took care to get the Licenſe taken from the Copies, as ſoon as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it. Here then we have an Evidence, how gladly the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would pick quarrels with us, and make us odious; tho' at the rate of telling lying Stories, which every one can contradict. He now beginneth, <hi>page</hi> 7. to give an Account of the Actings of the Presbyteries againſt the Prelatick Incumbents, between the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Meeting and the General Aſſembly, which ſate in <hi>October</hi> 1690. He blameth them, <hi>That they were more careful to Empty Churches, than to Fill them.</hi> This is not true, they endeavoured both to purge out the Scandalous, and ſuch as were like to do more Hurt than Good; and to plant the Churches with qualified Perſons; and ſomething was done both ways: Though we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, planting Work went more ſlowly on than was wiſhed; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe of the paucity of qualified Men; but mainly through the oppoſition that ſome Men of this Authors Temper made, <hi>Viis</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; modis</hi> to diſcourage people from Calling Miniſters: And to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex that Affair, when ever it was attempted. It is falſe, <hi>That none were ſent to the</hi> Weſt, <hi>where there was moſt need: And that they rather ſeated themſelves in</hi> Lothian, <hi>as being a better Countrey.</hi> There is neither Truth nor Candour in this Aſſertion: Even <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway</hi> (which therefore was moſt deſtitute, becauſe the Incumbents had generally either been driven away, or deſerted) is now tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably ſupplyed; tho' not ſo well as it ſhould be, or as I hope in a little more time it may be. He giveth a falſe and malicious Cauſe, of the ejecting of Miniſters in the end of <hi>page</hi> 8. viz. <hi>They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of their own Inabilities, and thought it not their Intereſt to tolerate ſuch as accuſtomed the people to Senſe and ſolid Diſcourſes.</hi> No other Anſwer is here fit, but to tell the Reader, That nothing but a fancy, tinctured with Malice and Prejudice, can make one ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them who were caſt out, with them who were put in. His Stories of what this Man or t'other ſaid, <hi>when a reaſon was asked of their putting out of Miniſters, and of their Preaching in Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſes where Epiſcopal Men were in the Church.</hi> Theſe, I ſay, are not worth our notice. We will not defend what every private perſon ſaith in Diſcourſe; yea, not what every particular Miniſter ſaith in the Pulpit, (tho' ſome Notes of Sermons he talketh of that I never heard of before, nor am at leiſure to enquire about them.) We can give better Reaſons for both theſe practices, <hi>viz.</hi> We put out Men, becauſe they are Scandalous, and unfit to Edifie the People, and do rather harden them in Wickedneſs: And we Preached in Meeting Houſes becauſe many, often the moſt part, of the Pariſhes, would not hear the Prelatical Incumbents.</p>

               <p>§ 8. There follows a whole Fardel of Lies and Malicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations, of the procedure of the Presbyteries: Few Lines in pages nine and ten that do not contain ſome Falſhood or other; as, <hi>That Presbyteries ſent out Spies to obſerve Mens publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Diſcourſes and Practices.</hi> Let them give one inſtance of this, as the act of any one Presbytery: If any private perſon did make ſuch enquiry, we know not, nor can we in all Caſes condemn it: That they received Libels of old Crimes, is not ſo abſurd as he would make us believe: If the Church have not been ſatisfied, nor the Scandal of them taken off. <hi>That a Deſign was formed to diſgrace the Clergy:</hi> That <hi>there was little or nothing made out againſt them;</hi> are a couple of falſhoods. The former no man can prove: The latter I have before diſproved; and could give abundance of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. That <hi>the Scandals of one, or a few was charged on the</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:33452:33"/> 
                  <hi>whole party;</hi> is an impudent and falſe Aſſertion: He ſaith, That <hi>the leaſt defects of Behaviour were heightned to groſs Crimes: And what was no fault we made one by uncharitable Conſtruction.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome private perſons, who had more Zeal than Underſtanding, might not do ſo, I cannot tell: But he is now ſpeaking of the Actings of the Judicatories; and that any of them did ſo, is falſe. That <hi>inſignificant Articles were accumulated to a great height;</hi> Is alſo ſaid, but cannot be proved. That <hi>ſome Miniſters were charged with Admitting to the Office of Elders, or not Cenſuring Men of Immoral Converſations;</hi> Is not to be blamed: The Apoſtle giveth expreſs Directions about the Qualifications that ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Elders: And it is certainly culpable to over-look Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals in any, and more eſpecially in Church Officers: That <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was offered in a Libel, by any Bigot, was admitted:</hi> Is no further true, than that they conſidered it, but what was found to be irrelevant, (as many things were) was rejected: And no man was Cenſured for it. The Libels of Mr. <hi>Graham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> ought not to have been mentioned by him; for the one had never any effect; nor was the man Cenſured. The other is before the Commiſſion, and the Sentence will be taken off, if it be found to be unjuſt. And I hope Presbyterians are not to be blamed, becauſe ſome leſs Intelligent people do, ſometimes, complain of men, where there is little Cauſe. It is next to ridiculous, that our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (having no more that he can deviſe againſt us) blotteth Paper, with <hi>what was deſigned to be Libelled againſt ſome;</hi> when it was not done; And with ſome <hi>frivolous Accuſations,</hi> that he ſaith, <hi>were made;</hi> when he cannot tell by whom, or againſt whom: I am weary of Tranſcribing theſe impertinent Recitals, of irrele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Libels, that were not uſed by Judicatories, as the ground of Sentences: About which he ſpendeth alſo <hi>pag.</hi> 11, and part of 12. Beſides what I have ſaid, let it be conſidered, that ſome of the Proceſſes on the Libels that he mentioneth, are yet depending and not diſcuſſed: As that of Mr. <hi>Crawford,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wood:</hi> Others of them are diſcuſſed, and the Sentence revoked by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the General Aſſembly, as that of Mr. <hi>Bowes</hi> of <hi>Abotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall.</hi>

And againſt <hi>Mr.</hi> Purveſs <hi>of</hi> Glencorſe, <hi>who accuſed the Witneſſes of Malice, as having aſſaulted him in the Pulpit, and that they were admitted to give Evidence againſt him:</hi> And he mentioneth what Mr. <hi>Selkirk</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Crightoun</hi> ſaid, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Conduct: This were certainly blame-worthy, if it were true, but indeed there is no truth in it, for neither did they ever pull him out of the Pulpit, nor take him by the Throat (as is alledged) only he having promiſed them to Preach no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and yet attempting to falfify his Promiſe, they did, without ſuch Violence, hinder him: Neither were ſuch words, or words to that effect, ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Selkirk:</hi> And ſome of the Witneſſes were rejected; and they who were admitted were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Malice, or partial Counſel, by their Solemn Oath. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

However ſuch practices we diſown, as far from our way. I am ſure it was not ſo done, but the contrary, in any Judicatory where I have been a Member. He ſaith, <hi>Accuſing Witneſſes were incouraged, and clearing Witneſſes not noticed:</hi> But giveth no Inſtances, wherefore I give the ſame reply to it, as to the former. He alſo accuſeth us, That <hi>when a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was read againſt a Miniſter at his own Church, the whole Libel was read, tho ſome Articles were frivolous, and others not proved.</hi> This alſo is but his Aſſertion, and no way proved.

He ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 15. That the <hi>moſt bigotted and hot-headed were choſen for the Aſſembly:</hi> And inſtanceth in two learned men who were not choſen. But it was evident to all beholders, who were capable to judge, and even to the conviction of ſome of his own Party, who had not abandoned all Reaſon, and good Nature, (as this man hath done) That the Aſſembly was made up of many Grave, Learned, and Sober men: And their Actings will prove it in deſpight of his reproaches and obloquy againſt them. The two whom he mentioneth are learned and worthy men: But all could not be choſen: And I know ſome very fit Perſons, out of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Modeſty, ſhunned it, and got others choſen. That it <hi>was concluded that Mr.</hi> George Campbel <hi>ſhould be ſhuffled out of the Aſſembly,</hi> is an Aſſertion Demonſtrative of a Brazen Forehead, in the Aſſerter: By whom was this concluded? Yea, or wiſhed? For my part, I know them not: Nor never heard of any ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His going ſo near to be choſen Moderator (which this Pamphlet taketh notice of) ſheweth, how acceptable he was to moſt of the Miniſters: But there is a ſort of men <hi>who ſhould have good Memories;</hi> which our Author here wanted. His baſe Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on ſome others, that were choſen, do ſhew his own Character: <hi>viz.</hi> Irreconcileable ſpite againſt all that bear the name of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians. We could tell of hundreds of his party, for one of ours, guilty of groſs immoralities: And even ſome who were in higheſt places in their Church; of whoſe repentance we have not heard much. But that we ſhould not have mentioned, if it had not been in defence of the Intereſt that he ſetteth himſelf to diſparage. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can eſcape the Laſh of this Authors virulent pen: <hi>P.</hi> 16. He moſt unmannerly taketh upon him to diſcourſe of <hi>the Kings Choice of a Commiſſioner, to repreſent his Royal Perſon in the Aſſembly:</hi> And to tell who <hi>was the fitteſt Perſon.</hi> Where he taketh occaſion to Calumniate the Earl of <hi>Crawford;</hi> by telling ſeveral groſs Lies about his Lordſhip: As that he <hi>rejoyced in the expectation of being Commiſſioner: And ſhewed a grudge at the diſappointment:</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:33452:35"/> Such malapart abuſing of any man, by judging his inward thoughts, (for I am ſure nothing of that kind ever appeared in his Lordſhips words or behaviour, but much to the contrary) but eſpecially, to deal ſo by ſo noble a Peer of the Nation, and who is ſo deſervedly honoured by all good men; this I ſay, deſerveth a more ſevere <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primand,</hi> than my pen can give: His Lordſhip did what in him lay to ſhun that difficult Poſt: As alſo the Noble Lord on whom it was caſt, was far from deſigning it. That the <hi>Earl ſat in the Aſſembly</hi> houſe before he was a Member, doth not prove what is intended by it: For ſo did many others, both Noblemen, and of inferiour qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Some out of Satisfaction they had to ſee the Church again ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on her ancient foundations; others out of Curioſity. That his Lordſhip <hi>did officiouſly meddle in all the concerns of the Aſſemblies, before he was a Member;</hi> is as remote from truth as <hi>Eaſt</hi> is from <hi>Weſt.</hi> The contrary appeared in his Lordſhips often refuſing to give advice when the Moderator deſired it. That letters were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to procure a Commiſſion to my Lord, is likewiſe falſe. It was voluntarily ſent to him from the Town of St. <hi>Andrews:</hi> He being Lord Provoſt of that Corporatin. We have a further falſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation upon that Noble Earl. That <hi>at the Viſitation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity at St.</hi> Andrews, <hi>he uſed the Maſters Roughly, particularly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuffer Mr.</hi> Weems, <hi>Infirm through age, to lean on the ſtep of a Stair.

               <p>§ 11. He cometh now at laſt, <hi>p.</hi> 17. to his purpoſe, to give account of the Aſſembly: And beginneth with the Sermons that were Preached at the opening of it. He quarrelleth that <hi>there were two Sermons:</hi> Saying, <hi>the Presbyterians can never have their full of Preaching.</hi> But the Reader may know that it hath been Cuſtomary in the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> (and none but ſuch mockers will reproach them for it) to make the firſt Day of the Aſſembly a Day of Faſting and Prayer; and two Sermons were no ſuperfluity in that caſe. The Sermons he alſo findeth fault with <hi>Mr.</hi> Cunningham's <hi>Sermon, that it was borrowed from Mr.</hi> Oliver Bowlis, <hi>being a Sermon that he Preached,</hi> Anno. 1643. The reverend and worthy Mr. <hi>Cunningham,</hi> being now at his reſt, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33452:35"/> anſwer for himſelf; nor tell us what to ſay for him in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: But this I can ſay in general (and will be believed by all that knew him, and are capable to judge) that few Miniſters of the Goſpel did outſtrip him in Miniſterial Qualifications: And he needed be beholding to no Man for a Sermon. The other Sermon by Mr. <hi>Patrick Symſon,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>was courſe Presbyterian ſtuff;</hi> but as Wiſe Men as he, thought it a Solid Pertinent, and Uſeful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to be preferred to hundreds of the Jingling, Py-bald Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that many of his party do ſpend the ſhort Glaſs with. What <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> he aſcribed to the Aſſembly, our Author would fain tell us, but ſheweth by his Expreſſions, that either his Ignorant Informers did not underſtand what was ſpoken. or he did not comprehend what they told him. What was ſaid on that Head, I do not remember; but we aſcribe no abſolute power to the General Aſſembly: That their power is immediately from Chriſt; that is, that no Man giveth it, we own: He falleth p. 18. on the chuſing of the Moderator. Where he taketh occaſion to ſpit all his Venom againſt the four Miniſters who were put on the Liſt, out of which the Moderator was to be choſen: All this I might paſs over; for my buſineſs is not to vindicate perſons, but things: And all who have read thus far in this Book, will be convinced that his <hi>Tongue is no ſlander;</hi> and the credit of thoſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is ſuch as he will not be able to Ruine, by his Lies and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. Wherefore I ſhall touch this part of his Satyr but lightly. Mr. <hi>Camphel,</hi> he ſaith nothing againſt, and indeed his praiſe is in the Churches: And our Author had met with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>page</hi> 15. And had told only of him, <hi>That to pleaſe his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren he had been more ſevere againſt the Epiſcopal Clergy than was his Wont.</hi> Nothing can be more falſe: He is no Man-pleaſer, and he always had a true Zeal againſt that way, and againſt the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities of ſome of them: And now ſheweth no more of Zeal than is conſiſtent with Wiſdom and Moderation. Mr. <hi>Rule</hi> cometh next on the Stage, <hi>He is called Doctor</hi> Rule, <hi>becauſe he did practiſe Medicine,</hi> and took the Degree of Doctor in it likewiſe, when he had no other way to maintain his Family; yet never giving over the Work of the Miniſtry; but preaching frequently. <hi>He was once Independent:</hi> That is abſolutely falſe. At <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Temptation, when he had great Offers to take the Charge of an Independent Congregation: And in <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (where he had his firſt Charge) he ſuffered no ſmall Loſs becauſe he would not fall in with that way.

He is ready, as he hath done, to give proof to the contrary, and to compete with this Pretender, when he will: For <hi>His Prayers in Latine;</hi> they are longer, or ſhorter, as the occaſion requireth; but never ſo ſhort as he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; neither doth he uſe to pray very long in publick, even in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> For the <hi>Ignorance diſcovered in the things he hath written;</hi> I wiſh this Scioliſt would make it appear by a ſolid Refutation: The paſſage that he bringeth for inſtance, he is ready to defend, with all the probability the ſubject Matter is capable of. And if it were a miſtake, it is no proof of Ignorance, to have a different Notion about a paſſage in an Author, from them who follow, as they lead, who have gone before them. If this <hi>Momus</hi> will make his Cenſure on the <hi>True Repreſentation of Presbyterian Government,</hi> it is like Mr. <hi>Rule,</hi> or ſome for him, will give him a fair Anſwer. But leſt all this be not enough to diſparage him, and his Miniſtry, <hi>He often venteth himſelf bitterly againſt the Epiſcopal Party:</hi> Others think quite contrary, few Presbyterians do more ſeldom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them, and an Argumentative way, rather than bitterneſs, is his ſtrain. If it can be made appear that he hath done otherwiſe, none ſhall blame him more than I ſhall do. The many particulars he is accuſed of, have obliged me to ſay more in his Vindication than I intended. In the next place he giveth a Character of Mr. <hi>Meldrum.</hi> He ſpendeth a great many words about him: But the whole matter is in ſhort, <hi>That once he complyed with Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, took the Oath of Canonical Obedience</hi> (which our Author is told, <hi>That he denyeth;</hi>) <hi>That going out for the Teſt, he left the Epiſcopal Party; becauſe when the Teſt was taken away, he was not permitted to return to his Miniſtry at</hi> Aberdeen. The Worth and Integrity of this Man is known to all in <hi>Scotland;</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, except them who prize no Man but for being like themſelves. That he complyed once, was a Token of Humane Infirmity: That he hath now left that way, is commendable; tho' it ſtir the Choler of this Scribler. His fourth Man is Mr. <hi>Kennedy,</hi> who was choſen Moderator, he is called Mr. <hi>Kennedy</hi> by his own party, and if any familiarly call him <hi>Father Kennedy,</hi> his Age may bear ſuch a Deſignation; but they who call him <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Beard,</hi> do miſtake his Temper. <hi>That he was with the Army at</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>or received</hi> 6000 <hi>Marks,</hi> is moſt falſe: He was never in <hi>England</hi> till 1690. when he was ſent, with others to <hi>London,</hi> with an Addreſs to the King. The Cauſes of his Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition 1660. are foully miſ-repreſented. It was only for his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:33452:36"/> in the matters that then divided the Church. That his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was never taken off till the Penult day of the Aſſembly, is not the leaſt of the Lies that this Paper is loaden with: It, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was taken off ſeveral years before, and this was ratified by the General Meeting ſome Months before the Aſſembly; and all that had been done in this matter was confirmed by the Aſſembly, a day before it was diſſolved.</p>

The Moderator being choſen: He telleth of a <hi>Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for the Clerkſhip:</hi> It may be, ſome of theſe perſons, that he nameth, might be mentioned in private Diſcourſes; but never any ſuch competition appeared before the Aſſembly: And moſt of them were ſo far from either petition or competition, that they rather declined it when it was mentioned to them by their Friends. He accuſeth the Aſſembly <hi>as inſufficient to repreſent the Church of</hi> Scotland, <hi>as that of</hi> Trent <hi>was to repreſent the Catholick Church:</hi> But he cannot deny that it repreſented the Presbyterian Church; and was all that could be had of a Presbyterian Aſſembly: And we deny not that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> repreſented the Popiſh, tho' not the Catholick Chriſtian Church, as was pretended. And indeed there were ſome from all parts of the Nation, even from the Northern Counties of <hi>Roſs, Murray, Aberdeen.</hi> That there wanted from one or two Counties, maketh nothing againſt the Authority of the Aſſembly: For there are places in the <hi>Highlands</hi> from which ſeldom or never there have been Commiſſioners at any Church Aſſembly. What <hi>Spirit ruled in this Aſſembly,</hi> he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth, with the ſame malice that hath hitherto appeared in his Book; and mocketh at the <hi>Prayers that were put up for another Spirit.</hi> By this, and ſuch like paſſages, it appeareth what Spirit acteth this Scribler. It is falſe, <hi>That the Presbyterians in</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>have always conteſted with their Kings about the Power of Calling Aſſemblies.</hi> Their Kings never denied their Intrinſick Power in this, except when they were influenced by a Prelatical, Eraſtian Crew about them: But on the contrary have ſetled it by their Laws, as the Churches priviledge: As in the Act 1592. which is ratified by an Act of this current Parliament; neither did they deny to the King a Power of Calling Aſſemblies, nor have ever refuſed to meet when called by him: We think it moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable when the King and the Church agree about this; and it mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this Mans ſpite, that Affairs were ſo managed in this Aſſembly. The ridiculous Expreſſion in Prayer that he imputeth to Mr. <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningham,</hi> calling <hi>it a pleaſant paſſage,</hi> is a meer Forgery: That
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:33452:37"/> Reverend and Wiſe Man, underſtood well what he ſaid. He is not aſhamed to tell Lies in the Face of the Sun, and to impoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Senſes; when he not only denieth <hi>the Kings Letter and the Aſſemblies Anſwer to it to be publiſhed</hi> (both which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in the printed Acts of the General Aſſembly) but he falſifieth the Kings Letter moſt palpably, in making the King ſay, <hi>That he ſetled the Government, becauſe it was agreeable to the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the People.</hi> Whereas it is, That Government which was judged to be ſo. And that <hi>He would have them do nothing that might diſpleaſe their Neighbour Church:</hi> Whereas the Letter ſaith, <hi>That Moderation is expected from them by their Neighbour Churches.</hi> He maketh no Churches their Standard; far leſs the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who His Majeſty well knew, were diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the very Being of that Aſſembly; and with all that they could Act, in managing of Presbyterian Government. He doth alſo miſ-repreſent the Aſſemblies Anſwer to His Majeſties Letter; as affirming, <hi>That their Government was not only agreeable to the Inclinations of the People, but moſt agreeable to the Word of God</hi> Whatever be our Opinion in that (which we neither deny nor: conceal) it is not ſo expreſſed: The words are, <hi>We are perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it is not more agreeable to the Inclinations and Conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſwaſions, of all within this Kingdom, who are beſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Your Majeſties Perſon and Government; than it is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</hi> He talketh next of <hi>an Act deſigned, but never concluded, for aſſerting the Divine Right of Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that it was the Legal Government of this Church:</hi> I think indeed that all the Aſſembly did concur in this Sentiment, but ſome thought it fit to expreſs it by an Act, and others thought is not expedient at this time; and it is like had regard to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſatisfaction, to whom it might have been uneaſie, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances. What harm was there in all this? <hi>Praecepta poſitiva non obligant ad ſemper?</hi> He ſaith, <hi>It is clear from our Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, That Presbytery was never ſetled but in Times of Rebellion: And that this is declared in a late Diſcourſe:</hi> But if he had pleaſed to read what is written on both ſides, he might have ſeen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary cleared in a <hi>late Vindication,</hi> in Anſwer to that Diſcourſe, what a Member ſaid in Parliament, <hi>That Presbytery was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (or the beſt) Security againſt the Encroachments of Kings;</hi> was much diſreliſhed by all that heard it, and ſuſpected to proceed from no good will to Presbyterian Government; nor are Presbyterians obliged to Anſwer for it: The Aſſembly did indeed <hi>promiſe Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>

And he is ſo ridiculous, as to take notice of the leaſt word that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped any in the Aſſembly: By which he ſheweth both his Malice, and how little it hath to work upon; when he muſt pick up ſuch things to fill up his pages, as <hi>that one moved, that ſome might be imployed to preach in the Churches of Conformiſts in</hi> Edinburgh: Which was not ſeconded by any in the Aſſembly. His General, account of Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi>'s Sermon cannot be anſwered: It was ſatisfying to Intelligent, and Serious, Unbyaſſed Hearers, tho may be, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Mockers. What one <hi>Hamilton</hi> ſaid, <hi>of want of the Goſpel for</hi> 38 <hi>Years;</hi> I never before heard of; and look on it as invented by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or ſome of his Informers. The reſt of the Sermons (except theſe of Mr. <hi>Carſtairs,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wylie</hi> whoſe praiſes as eminent Preachers of the Goſpel, their Brethren do not envy) he Treateth with that Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Malice, and contempt, that is ſuteable to the Hiſtorical Talent of many of his party. If he had mentioned any evidences of ſuch faultineſs in theſe Sermons, they ſhould have been conſidered: But his Railing De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations are to be deſpiſed. If the Debauchery of his party did not more <hi>tempt People to count all Religion a ſham,</hi> than the Preaching of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians doth, it were well. His bitter taunting of the Prayers of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God (which is his work. <hi>p.</hi> 35.) Is neither like to bring Credit to Religion, nor to his Cauſe: Was it ever heard of before, among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that when ſo weighty affairs were in hand, ſpending time in Prayer was fit to be ridiculed: If this be to be vile, we will be yet more vile: And will contemn what may be the ſentiment about it, of ſuch as he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth. I am ſure they whom he thus ridiculeth, minded nothing but to ſeek help of God to manage his work right; and the Lord was pleaſed to help them to pray, and a return of their Prayers was not wanting. An unſavoury expreſſion he mentioneth, to have been uſed in Prayer (<hi>p.</hi> 36.) Which I do not remember to have heard; but it is not unuſual for this Hiſtorian to Coyn, where he wanteth wherewith to reproach us. He blameth <hi>The ſlow proceedings of the Aſſembly:</hi> And if more haſte had been made, he would certainly called it Raſhneſs, and precipitation: For he hath a mind to find Fault. He talketh of <hi>differences among us which were ſmoothered.</hi> Was ever ſo many men met, where there was no different apprehenſions of either the matters, or the way of managing them, or the wording of things? and was it not prudence to compromiſe what might
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33452:38"/> tend to a difference? but let his malice prompt his Critical Skill to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Capacity, I hope he cannot ſhew that we did not agree in what was material, or that we could not bear with one another in what was of leſs moment. Our receiving them who had broken the Unity of the Church, and were <hi>called Cameronians,</hi> he endeavoureth to turn to our reproach. It is true they gave in a Paper that we were not pleaſed with, to ſatisfie their own miſtking Conſciences, and to quiet the People whom they had led aſide: We were far from approving that Paper, but did expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn it: And accepted them on another which they gave in, which contained nothing but their Submiſſion to the Church, and their promiſe of endeavouring to preſerve the Unity of it. Who can blame this? and is it not the exerciſe of that moderation which becometh the Goſpel? But that <hi>they were told,</hi> that <hi>they had done us good ſervice,</hi> or that any inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made of approving of their former way, is among the reſt of his falſe Repreſentations which his Book is ſtuffed with. For what end he taketh notice of the competition about Mr. <hi>Semple,</hi> I know not: For here is no matter of reproach: Only he miſrepreſenteth the debate about allowing ſome Miniſters to go to <hi>Northumberland,</hi> at the deſire of the People there: Much more was ſaid for it, than he mentioneth; and what was of more weight: And what he doth notice is falſely narrated: There was no mention made <hi>of planting the Goſpel in England:</hi> He whom our Author imputeth this to, never thought that they of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had not the Goſpel: Nor was it ſaid <hi>that between Berwick and Newcaſtle they wanted the word of God;</hi> but, that the Presbyterians want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ordinances of the Goſpel; not being allowed to enjoy them with the Church, unleſs they would comply with humane Ceremonies in the Worſhip of God; which they could not do with a good Conſcience. What was ſaid of the <hi>Practice of Piety in thoſe parts,</hi> I do not remember; I know there are not a few in that place of the Country, who may be in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity, thought to fear the Lord: And there are alſo many, yea, a far greater number, of whom the Aſſertion he mentioneth is true. The truth is, this Author hath inured himſelf to the fouleſt Lies and Calumnies, that he can hardly ſpeak or write Truth. A further inſtance of this is, <hi>p.</hi> 39.

About the Earl of <hi>Crawford's receiving a Commiſſion from the Town of St.</hi> Andrews <hi>to repreſent them as Ruling Elder in the Aſſembly;</hi> I have ſaid enough above to ſtop his mouth, and to refel what he here ſaith; only he addeth, that <hi>Joy might be ſeen in my Lords Countenance when be received it;</hi> which none could perceive, except ſuch as can fancy any thing that their ill-will ſuggeſteth to them. For my Lords <hi>ſeeking time of Deliberation till</hi> Lammas, <hi>as Mr.</hi> Campbel <hi>had;</hi> it was not intended as what he ſought with expectation, but as an expreſſion of his wiſh; and of his diſlike of allowing ſo much time to Mr. <hi>Camphel,</hi> to the great detriment of the Colledge; at which others alſo were diſſatisfied, tho' they quietly acquieſced in the determination of the Aſſembly. For the Petition from <hi>Dundie,</hi> it was not ſaid, <hi>They had not the Goſpel;</hi> for they had one Miniſter.

But that the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, or any elſe, ſaid, that <hi>there was no true Miniſter in</hi> Angus, is a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, like moſt of his other Aſſertions: For none of us deny the Epiſcopal Miniſters to be truly Miniſters; tho' we think a Biſhop alone ſhould not Ordain. It is alſo falſe, that any ſuch expreſſion was uſed by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as, <hi>offering the Goſpel to the people of</hi> Angus: The words are, that <hi>they ſhould go to</hi> Angus, <hi>and travel in the Work of the Goſpel, in Vacant Churches, and where they ſhould be called.</hi> This is far from ſuppoſing that the Goſpel was not in that County; or that there were no Miniſters there. It is of the ſame ſtamp, that he maketh the Moderator tell two young men, who had been preaching in <hi>Angus,</hi> and had ill reception
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33452:39"/> there; That <hi>as they had offered the Goſpel to that people in the name of the General Meeting, ſo they ſhould now offer it in the name of the Aſſembly.</hi> We offer the Goſpel to all whom we preach to, in the name of Chriſt, and not in the name of men. Another Imputation of the ſame kind is, that the Moderator ſaid, <hi>We will plant Miniſters in</hi> Dundie, <hi>whether the Town-Council will or not.</hi> I do not remember that ſuch words were ſpoken, or words to that effect: But if they were, what the Moderator ſaith, is not always the mind of the Aſſembly; but only when a thing is propoſed, and aſſented to, either by Vote, or by Silence. He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 34. <hi>Of Mr.</hi> William Spence, <hi>who conformed, but fell off from the Biſhops, becauſe denied an Augmentation of Stipend: He ſpread Papers againſt them; they depoſed, and excommunicated him. This man was ſent by the Aſſembly, to preach in</hi> Angus. <hi>Anſ.</hi> That <hi>Mr. William Spence</hi> fell off from the Epiſcopal party on the account mentioned, is utterly falſe: But it is the way of theſe men, when any fall from their way, from conviction of Conſcience (as many have done) to aſcribe it to ſome other Cauſe: And it is but ſuitable to their temper, who know not what it is to concern their own Conſciences in ſuch matters. Their Depoſing and Excommunicating him, was for his breaking off from their Communion, and his expreſſing his Reaſons, and for ſpeaking againſt ſome of their practices, which galled them: And therefore the General Meeting, <hi>Octob.</hi> 11. 1687. After ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act ſearch into the grounds of his Sentence, did find and declare it to be void: and this was ratified by the General Aſſembly, <hi>Nov.</hi> 12. 1690.</p>

And Mr.</hi> Meldrum <hi>heard this read in the Aſſembly, and did not Contradict it.</hi> which the Author heavily agggravateth. This is another Groſs miſ-repreſentation; like the former: Neither they who deſired Miniſters, nor they who ſent them, did any way ſuppoſe that <hi>Aberdeen</hi> had not the Goſpel, or Miniſters; bur that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians there wanted a Miniſter, and deſired to be ſupplied: Which was accordingly taken care of. That <hi>Mr.</hi> Meldrum <hi>was not ſent to</hi> Aberdeen, was no neglect of him; the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> intending him for other Work: For the City of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and Colledge of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors for him, before the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly.

This he not only aſſerteth, but layeth weight on it, as <hi>ſufficient ground for ſeparating from us, as perſons who teach another Goſpel,</hi> p. 37. He pretendeth to give an account of the Aſſemblies deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them who had appealed to them from Presbyteries, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by them: And here he cannot find matter of reproach in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſent to the King, to ſatisfie His Majeſty in this matter; but he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth <hi>a draught of that Letter propoſed, which was appointed to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> This is to pick Quarrels. A draught of a Letter ſo worded, as he ſaith, or of that importance, I do not remember of, but ſeeing he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it did not pleaſe the Aſſembly, why ſhould it be brought to their Reproach? It is a groſs Lie, <hi>That they were referred back to the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Synods from which they had appealed,</hi> (that I confeſs had been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd:) They were all referred to the Commiſſion, except ſuch as the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly diſcuſſed; and that of Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> which was referred to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. In which Synod, when his Caſe was tryed, the Presbytery of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi> as a Party, was removed, although Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> in his printed Paper hath the Impudence to deny that they were removed. <hi>That it was thought grievous to Presbyteries to queſtion the Juſtice and Legality of their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> is alſo falſe; for then no Appeal could be received from them, nor any Proceſs re-examined by a Superior Judicatory; which yet that was done. The <hi>Affair of</hi> Peebles (that he next mentioneth) is ſo far from being <hi>proof of their unwillingneſs to canvaſs the Actings of a Presbytery,</hi> that it is an evidence to the contrary; ſeeing they did take that buſineſs into conſideration, and not having time to diſcuſs it, did refer it to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, who did ſo determine in it, as both parties did quietly ſubmit. It is true, when it was brought into the Aſſembly, ſome moved that it might be firſt ripened in the Committee, which was readily complied with. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there <hi>any conteſt about it between my Lord Commiſſioner and the Aſſembly;</hi> as he falſly inſinuateth. The printed Information that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth, had a printed Anſwer by Mr. <hi>Vetch:</hi> They were both conſidered by the Aſſembly. There were a great many Heretors on both ſides; it is true, none who were of the Duke of <hi>Queensbury</hi>'s Quality; but his Grace had not his Reſidence in the Pariſh. The paſſage in Mr. <hi>Vetch</hi>'s Anſwer, from which he thinketh he hath ſo much advantage, maketh nothing for his Deſign. For it was not ſaid, <hi>That a Call from the greateſt part of the Pariſh, could not be had to a Presbyterian Miniſter;</hi> But that a Call from all could not be had (tho' even ſo it was too general an Aſſertion, for
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33452:40"/> many Pariſhes there are in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where Presbyterians are called with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a diſſenting Vote) and doth it hence fellow, that the people are not generally for Presbytery; becauſe in many Pariſhes (yea if it were in all Pariſhes) there are ſome of another mind; or becauſe in ſome Pariſhes, moſt are againſt it: I do not intend to dip in that Affair; nor to conſider the Merits of that Cauſe; but do refer the Reader to the Papers that are printed on both ſides; only I affirm, that the General Aſſembly, nor their Commiſſion, cannot be blamed in this matter, ſeeing both parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in their Sentence. Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi>'s reſolution (againſt <hi>Obtruding himſelf on a people againſt their will</hi>) is conſonant to the Sentiments of his Brethren, and yet the Nation may enjoy Presbyterian Miniſters: For there are many more places willing to receive them, than there are men to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy ſuch places.

That the <hi>Aſſembly was ſo puzled,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>about the Appeals of tth Epiſcopal Clergy,</hi> is falſe: And the Compariſon that he uſeth is Odious, and Malicious: They were no other way ſtraitened about them, but that they wanted time to examine them all: And on that Account alone refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to the Commiſſion: <hi>Some of them,</hi> he confeſſeth, <hi>they ventured upon:</hi> And theſe he quarrelleth with.

All that the Aſſembly had to judge was, whether Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> was legal Miniſter at <hi>Turriff</hi> in 1661. And they found that clearly proved, whence it followed; that Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> by the Act of Parliament, had right now to return to his place, which had been poſſeſſed by Mr. <hi>Lesk:</hi> It was prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> was legally ſettled in <hi>Turriff:</hi> That he was unjuſtly Depoſed by the Presbytery about 1655. That this Sentence was taken off by the Synod of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> in which the presbytery of <hi>Turriff</hi> is; and that in <hi>July</hi> 1661. he was Depoſed by the Synod of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance with the Courſes of that time. Whence they concluded, that he was Rightful Miniſter of <hi>Turriff,</hi> and the Act of Parliament allowing ſuch as were put out in 1661. did allow him to return to <hi>Turriff.</hi> It is falſe, that <hi>the Reaſons of the Sentence were refuſed to be given him,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:33452:40"/> (Mr. <hi>Lesk</hi>) for he demanded an extract of the proceſs, and Sentence, and the Clerk was appointed to give it. He complaineth that <hi>That the Act of Parliament gave acceſs to the Presbyterians who had been poſſeſſed of places, tho the Epiſcopal men had complyed with the Civil Government:</hi> And was it rational that they ſhould poſſeſs the Rights of other Men, becauſe they comply with the time? was not the ſame done in <hi>England</hi> 1660; If Mr. <hi>Kirtoun</hi> had uſed his priviledge, in emptying his Church for a fitter perſon than it was poſſeſſed by, it was not againſt Law: <hi>Mertoun</hi> was his Charge till he was tranſported to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> But the Truth is Mr. <hi>Kirtoun</hi> went not to <hi>Mertoun,</hi> till the Epiſcopal Miniſter had left it, as knowing he had no legal Right: And when Mr. <hi>Kirtoun</hi> went thither, and got right to the Stipend of a year and half: He gave the years Stipend to the Epiſcopal Miniſter, who had left the place; and the half year to the poor. Mr. <hi>Sleerie</hi>'s Caſe cometh next, which is not truly narrated: It is falſe <hi>that he was deprived of his Church,</hi> for he was never orderly ſettled in it; neither in the Epiſcopal, nor the Presbyterian way: It is alſo falſe, <hi>That he was diſcharged the exerciſe of his Miniſtry:</hi> He may preach where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath an orderly Call: Only he is diſcharged to exerciſe it at <hi>Fawkirk:</hi> and in the bounds of the Presbytery of <hi>Lithgow,</hi> unleſs he be allowed by the Presbytery: And indeed it is not allowed that any man ſhould Preach within the bounds of any Presbytery, without their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>once: Mr. <hi>Sleerie</hi> acknowledged his Fault in continuing to Preach there, having no orderly Call, nor being permitted by the Presbytery; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared (before the Sentence) his willingneſs to forbear Preaching there: And the Aſſembly, upon his deſire repreſented his want to my Lord Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, and the Earl of <hi>Crawford;</hi> and they promiſed to deal for ſome Relief to him, from the Council, For <hi>asking him about the Doxology, and whether he repented of his conformity.</hi> I do not remember it, I am ſure it was not appointed by the Aſſembly to be done. The following pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt Mr. <hi>Forſyth,</hi> our Author approveth, as <hi>the only juſtifiable Act of the Aſſembly.</hi> It is well they pleaſe him in one thing at leaſt. Mr. <hi>John Mackenzies</hi> caſe he narrateth very unfairly; hardly any came to hear him: And he had no due Title to that charge, becauſe his Edict (which even by the Epiſcopal way, ſhould have been ſerved at <hi>Kirkliſtoun</hi>) was ſerved at St. <hi>Andrews;</hi> So that the people of <hi>Kirkliſtoun</hi> had no occaſion either to object againſt him, or to conſent to his being their Miniſter: And he ſeldom preaching to that Congregation, the Presbytery removed him from that Church, but did not take away his Miniſtry; he appealed to the Aſſembly, but did not proſecute the Appeal: Wherefore the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly could not ſhun confirming the Sentence of the Presbytery. What is ſaid to have been ſpoken about the matter, by this and other perſons, I
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:33452:41"/> am not concerned to enquire, nor do I know, or believe to be true, what he confidently ſetteth down. As to what he ſaith of Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> I have above told why he was referred to the Synod: About Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> he doth not tell the truth, he was neither referred to the Presbytery nor Synod; but to the Commiſſion of the Aſſembly, who have taken his Caſe into conſideration.</p>

Our Intrants to the Miniſtry are able to vie Learning with the Epiſcopal Candidates, and are far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. That <hi>Brewers and Illiterate Trades-men are ſet up to be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> is falſe, and ſlanderous. I deny not but ſome who in the late Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution were forced to follow other Imployments for a livelihood, have now reſumed their former Studies: But they are not admitted, without giving good proof of a Competency, at leaſt, of knowledge in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in the Controverſies in Divinity. And the ſame fate hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen his own Party, that he reproacheth us with. Some of them now follow other Imployments; particularly ſome are turned Brewers; as Mr. <hi>Norman Mackenzie</hi> late Miniſter at <hi>Midcalder,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Henry</hi> late Miniſter at <hi>Corſtorfine,</hi> have ſet up a Brewery in the Suburbs of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh;</hi> which I mention not to reproach them (for it is commendable to follow a Lawful Calling rather than to be Idle, or to be chargeable to others) but to ſtop the mouth of this Reviler. The Inſtance he giveth of Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> in his Tryals, that he denied the Major of an <hi>Enthymem,</hi> that he deſired the terms of the Minor of a Hypothetick Syllogiſm to be explained, which was, <hi>Sed verum prius:</hi> That the Presbytery ſaid, that he wanted Learning, yet he had Grace; and upon that admitted him: Every word of this is falſe. Every Miniſter in that Presbytery is ready to witneſs the contrary: And I have what I affirm under the hand of one of them who was preſent at all his Tryals; whoſe underſtanding and vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, none who knoweth him will queſtion. Mr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> hath the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he hath a meaſure of Learning which is no ways deſpicable: That he hath a very good gift of Preaching and Praying. His complaint, <hi>p.</hi> 48. <hi>Of the Deſolation of the Colledges, and the inſufficiency of theſe who are placed in them,</hi> is ſurely not from Knowledge, but from Malice, and a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33452:41"/> reſolution to reproach; it is a Fooliſh conteſt, who are the more Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Till it can be put to the Tryal. Not only the eſteem of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and impartial men (neither of which properties this Author hath given proof of in his Book) and the <hi>Judicia</hi> of Learning that any have given, muſt carry it: To both which, men of our ſide can appeal, when they are compared with their Predeceſſors; whether <hi>in knowledge of Books in any part of good and uſeful Learning, or in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pableneſs to direct the Studies of the youth:</hi> Yea in <hi>Grammar</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any of the learned Languages: Tho' I think neither party hath much cauſe to brag of their Abilities: Except in compariſon. It is a baſe Calumny, to call the <hi>Presbyterian Spirit, Narrow, and an Enemy to Knowledge;</hi> much more is it ſo, to Aſſert, that we <hi>count it impiety to call commonly received Principles into queſtion:</hi> Or that we reckon <hi>a free and Rational inquiry into the Reaſons of them to be Dangerous.</hi> It is the bent of our ſtudies to ſearch the Scripture, and to conſult ſound Reaſon, both that we may know what is Truth, and how it appeareth to be ſo. It is an Ignorant miſtake, to ſay, that <hi>we count the Carteſians and other Syſtems of new Philoſophy, to be groſs and Damnable Hereſie.</hi> there are among us who have oppoſed many of the old, commonly received, <hi>Ariſtotelian</hi> Principles, more early and, may be, with more ſtrength of Reaſon, then ſuch as he are capable to do. For the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Syſtem, he might know (but that his knowledge is ſo narrow as to be confined to his own Party) that there are Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Carteſians, as well as Epiſcopal Carteſians. For mine own part, I very much value many things in that Learned and Thinking Author; but I durſt never ſwallow down all his Notions, as I ſee ſome men do. I averr and will maintain it; that ſome of them lead to Atheiſm, others to unhinge ſome of the Truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; others are without ground or reaſon, tho' they be of no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Conſequence. But his impertinency hath led me into this Digreſſion.

They of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> are ſo far from being his Enemies, that they have adventured to keep him in his place, which ſome think to be againſt Law. Who they are that ſay, <hi>the Mathematical Sciences are uſeleſs, or dangerous;</hi> I know not: If I ſhall meet with any ſuch, I will contradict him to his Face. It is another Calumny, that <hi>we ſlight the Hebrew, and other Oriental Tongues:</hi> We do highly prize them, and wiſh they were much more common than they are, both among his
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33452:42"/> party and ours.

He knoweth alſo, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> who are Patrons of the Colledge, have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to readmit him to that Office, If he will qualifie himſelf, as the Law requireth, and that ſome of the Maſters of that Colledge, who are Presbyterian, have often, and earneſtly dealt with him that he would not refuſe the proffer that the City hath made to him, and that the place hath been now a year kept Vacant, and a door left open for him to return: So much do we value men of Learning. But Presbyterians have no diſpenſing power: And the Law is plain. The <hi>Favourable aſpect that the Jewiſh Synagogue caſteth on Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> we deny not: But it looketh as broadly toward a Papacy. That <hi>the Trade of Books is fallen on the occaſion of this Revolution,</hi> is his groundleſs Fancy. For in <hi>Edinburgh</hi> there are of late more Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers than were before, but I am ſure in 1661. and 1662. I have heard Bookſellers ſadly complain of it. The Books that he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth as <hi>The ſtandard of Presbyterian Learning,</hi> We do not deſpiſe: But it is known that there are no Books truely va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, among his Party, but ſuch as we uſe, and that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently; when many who Brag of their Books are worſe Imployed. The Sermons of Presbyterians, he taketh ſome pains to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: The Sermons that were Printed here, were ſo appointed by Authority; and are able to endure the Cenſure of rational Men; not of railing Scriblers, who reſolve to Cenſure, and to condemn all on that ſide, without Wit or Diſcretion, the <hi>Collection of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notes</hi> that he ſpeaketh of, if it be of what was indeed ſpoken, and candidly repreſented; we fear it not (tho' neither his Party, nor ours, can anſwer for all that is ſpoken) if it be of the ſtrain of this Pamphlet; that is, a heap of Lyes and Railing, We will diſpiſe it. <hi>Mr.</hi> Clerks <hi>Sermon,</hi> that he ſpeaketh of, I have not Read: He is able to anſwer for himſelf: His ſpeaking with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Mr.</hi> Gray's <hi>Sermons,</hi> ſheweth his skill in the things that concern the Actings of Grace in the Soul.

But here is an Evidence of the Learning, and Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of this Pretender to Learning, or of his Wife Informers: May be, he might ſay, that many who were bent for private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, are ſo ignorant, as to look on Baptiſm to have its effects <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> or as a Charm, and this is taken for ſaying, <hi>that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Baptiſm is a Charm.</hi> He doth falſly repreſent Mr. <hi>Kirtons</hi> Words: He did indeed plead againſt that Act, but his Diſcourſe was neither ſo unpoliſhed, nor ſo peremptory, as our Author maketh it. It is falſe, <hi>that Baptiſm in the Countrey cannot be had but on Sundays.</hi> A Miniſter may Baptize every day of the Week, if notice be given to the Congregation to meet for hearing the Word: If any Miniſter do refuſe to Baptize a Week day, ſo as in no caſe he will do it, he hath no Countenance from this Act. I know not why a Miniſter may not call the Congregation together to hear the Word, on occaſion of Baptiſm to be Adminiſtred: If few come, it is their own blame; and needs not hinder that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. We did not ſcruple to Baptize in private, when we, with all the Ordinances Adminiſtred by us, were driven into corners; but we always held that this Solemn Ordinance of God ſhould be as publick as the other Ordinances are; it being a Seal of that Covenant, which is held forth by Preaching of the Goſpel, we think it ſhould not be done in a Corner, when the other is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly diſpenſed. But I ſhall not now fully diſpute this point: If any of our Opponents pleaſe to let us hear their Arguments againſt it, we ſhall conſider them. The Story that he telleth; of a <hi>Child ſent away from the Church unbaptized, becauſe it was not brought to Church till about the cloſe of the Sermon:</hi> This Story, I ſay, is not true, nothing is more ordinary with us, than that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren come late, even when the Sermon is almoſt ended: Yea, ſome of us have Baptized Children whom we knew not of till the other Children were already Baptized: The Child that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, was not preſented to be Baptized, till after Prayer, and Pſalms, and the Bleſſing; and the People were diſmiſſed, and the Miniſter was gone out of the Pulpit. It is falſe, that the <hi>People are Diſpleaſed with this:</hi> It is but ſome of them, and theſe either the leſs Intelligent, or ſuch as are inclined to the Epiſcopal way. That <hi>Mr.</hi> Kirtoun <hi>did Preach againſt the Superſtition of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:33452:43"/> (viz.</hi> of Baptiſm) is not only falſe, but ſo conſiſtent with his way, and Principles, that it is a wonder that this Author could alledge ſuch a thing; or be ſo forgetful of what Mr. <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun</hi> had ſaid, as himſelf relateth it, but in the former page. The Aſſembly appointed a Liſt of Acts to be drawn which were fit to be obſerved: And this Authors malevolent pen repreſenteth this, as if <hi>They durſt not approve of ſome Acts, and yet would not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them.</hi> Whereas they intended no more, but that there being many Acts ſuted to the time when they were made, but might be inconvenient for this time: Others that were fit for our Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, might be diſtinguiſhed from theſe; and is not this a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice in Parliaments, without having ſuch malicious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections made on it. That <hi>We receive all the Acts of Aſſemblies as if they were Scripture; and pay no leſs regard to them;</hi> Is an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion as falſe as any thing can be ſaid.</p>

Their <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Rigidity</hi> (which he very poſitively, and confidently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth about) muſt be judged of by their Actings: I am ſure the plurality of them are look'd upon as Men of very Moderate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples! But no Presbyterian can be moderate in this mans Opinion. In the Liſt of them he alſo miſtaketh; for many were on both Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions: Whereas he maketh the two to conſiſt wholly of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſons; but that is not material. His account of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate about the Inſtructions to the Commiſſion, I need not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: What was concluded, is that which we are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33452:43"/> in. His Account of the Inſtructions is moſt falſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. It is ſtrange prevarication ſo to corrupt and falſify a Paper in the Tranſcribing of it. Take for example, the 2<hi>d</hi> Article (which he maketh the firſt) He hath it, <hi>That they ſhall take into their Cognizance all References and Appeals, not diſcuſſed in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and ſuch matters as have been tabled before the Aſſembly.</hi> Where he maketh two ſorts of things to fall under their conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Whereas in the true Copy nothing but what is expreſly referred to them is mentioned: It is thus, <hi>To take into their Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance all References and Appeals, and other things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtated before this Aſſembly ſhall by them be ſpecially referred to the ſaid Commiſſion, to determine the ſame.</hi> The Debate that was in the Aſſembly about the ſixth Article; about taking in the late Conformiſts to Miniſterial Communion, he doth alſo Miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; it is falſe that it was ſaid, <hi>That by theſe Inſtructions, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for Conformity, is required as a Condition.</hi> For that ws debated in the Committee; and it was determined to be left out; becauſe the worſt of them would be readieſt to profeſs Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Which they who acted from a Principle could not do. He obſerveth from the Inſtructions, page 57. That <hi>the Commiſſion was mainly deſigned againſt the Epiſcopal Clergy.</hi> I deny not that it was deſigned againſt ſuch of them as were unqualified for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to caſt them out: And againſt ſuch of them as were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Eſtabliſhed Church Government, to keep them from a Capacity to overturn it. But it was rather deſigned for them who fall not under theſe Characters, to take them in among us. That <hi>Presbyterians had Malice agaenſt them,</hi> or <hi>ſuch Deſigns to ruine them,</hi> as he alledgeth, is evil ſurmiſing: And in this he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of others by the temper of his own mind.</p>

He looketh on <hi>all the Facts appointed by Presbyterians as deſigned to enſnare the Epiſcopal Men;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that they Faſted for Strife and Debate.</hi> Their Witneſs is on high, who knoweth that other Motives engaged them to Faſt and Pray: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuch things as are of common concernment to all who have true Zeal for Religion. But this Gentleman, and others of his Stamp, did not uſe to keep Solemn Faſts for the concernments of the Goſpel: Only ſometimes they had Faſts with the reſpect to the Weather; or when there was like to be a bad Harveſt; which we condemn not: But think there are greater things that ſhould move us to ſuch Duties. It ſeems he knoweth no other ground of Faſting, but either averting of ſome outward Judgment; or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:33452:44"/> ſome politick deſign. He mainly challengeth the Faſt appointed by the Aſſembly, becauſe in the cauſes of it, mention is made of Epiſcopacy; the ſetting up of which is complained of; on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that it <hi>was always grievous to this Nation,</hi> and <hi>that it was done without the Churches conſent, and contrary to Acts of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Aſſemblies.</hi> As alſo, <hi>that a great decay of Piety was viſible under it.</hi> This is all that was ſaid of Epiſcopacy in theſe cauſes of the Faſt. This Faſt, he ſaith, <hi>Epiſcopal Men could not obſerve, without looking on Epiſcopacy as unlawful: As the cauſe of much Impiety; as defection from God and his truth: Nor without blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and other Proteſtant Churches; yea the Catholick Churches from the Apoſtles to</hi> Calvin'<hi>s time.</hi> Anſ. 1<hi>ſt.</hi> What ever be our Sentiments about Epiſcopacy, nothing is here expreſſed that needeth to ſtumble them who think it a lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church; and there are ſome of that Principle, who will ſay as much as is here ſaid. Norhing is here ſaid of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulneſs, nothing of its influence on Impiety: But only of its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved unſutableneſs to this Nation, and of ungodlineſs having been <hi>de facto</hi> its concomitant. 2. If any did conſcientiouſly ſcruple the Obſervation of the Faſt, on the grounds mentioned, I ask who of them have been Puniſhed by the State, or Cenſured by the Church, for this omiſſion: The Church thought fit to lay Peoples duty before them, yet uſing all lenity toward them who cannot ſee their duty. It was quite otherwiſe in former times, when his party had the Rule. 3. The ſetting up of Epiſcopacy was more ſinful in this Nation, than it could be elſewhere, becauſe of the Oath of God that the Nation is under againſt it: Not in later times only; but in the time of King <hi>James</hi> the 6th, who cauſed the whole Nation ſwear the <hi>Shorter Confeſſion of Faith</hi> called alſo the <hi>National Covenant;</hi> where it is Abjured. 4. All this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that we do not meddle with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in this matter; but keep within our own bounds: And therefore ſhe hath no cauſe to be offended with us, more than we have to blame her, for ſetting up Epiſcopacy. 5. His big words of <hi>other Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches,</hi> and <hi>the Catholick Church to</hi> Calvin'<hi>s time,</hi> are the Dialect of his Party: Whoſe confidence of Aſſertion, and ſtrength of Argument, in this matter, bear no proportion: Which we are ready to try with him, when he pleaſeth. The Councils Act for Obſervation of this Faſt, he doth alſo moſt cauſeleſly, and petulantly ridicule: What is more congruous than when the fear of God doth not perſwade men to their Duty, that a civil Court ſhould deal
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33452:44"/> with them by a civil Penalty? The conteſt about the <hi>Printer to the Aſſembly</hi> he cannot let paſs; tho' he can get no advantage there againſt the Presbyterians: But that <hi>they muſt have a Printer diſtinct from the Kings Printer.</hi> It hath always been the Cuſtom; and our Kings never diſallowed it. We are far from contending with the King about it, nor do we plead a Divine Right for it. The Debate between the two Printers before the Council we are not concerned in. Only I obſerve his Malicious Lye, <hi>That the Earl of</hi> Crawford <hi>maintained, that the King ſhould yield to the Aſſembly.</hi> His Lordſhip is far from ſo owning the Church, as to deny to the King any reſpect that is due.</p>

After Apology for the length (he ſhould have rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the Diſhoneſty and Impertinency) of this Epiſtle; He ventureth yet upon two or three things. The 1<hi>ſt.</hi> is, the Aſſemblies appointing an anſwer to be made to theſe Pamphlets of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Party (which this Paper containeth) where he is much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed: Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> was never enjoyned this task: Mr. <hi>Pitcarne</hi> had it laid on him, but after many Months, it was not done: And ſo they laid it on another; Not on him with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of others; as this Author ſaith. That Mr. <hi>Meldrum</hi> juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Rable in a Sermon, is ſo far from his Temper and Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that none will Affirm it, but ſuch an one as this Hiſtorian. He ſaith, we <hi>will never prove any material Circumſtance, in matter of Fact to be falſe;</hi> I affirm and have made it appear that few, if any of them are true. His next particular is the moſt Notorious falſhood that can be expreſſed by Tongue or Pen. <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>the taking off the Sentence of Depoſition againſt ſome Miniſters, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Remonſtrators was propoſed, but laid aſide in the General meeting, and now done in the end of the Aſſembly.</hi> It was done in a meeting of the Brethren of the Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> (for them within that bounds) and in the General Meeting for them, and all others in <hi>Scotland:</hi> And what the Aſſembly did was a Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what had already been effectually done: What he alledged Mr. <hi>Gilbert Rule</hi> to have ſaid, in the Aſſembly, on this head, is a wide miſtake; he only pleaded, that the Act ſhould not be ſo Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, as to comprehend all who were cenſured in the times of theſe differences, becauſe ſome might, at that time, be cenſured for uncontroverted Scandals (tho' he did not pretend to give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of any who were ſo Cenſured) but that the Act ſhould only reach them who were Cenſured on account of the Differences, <hi>Hinc inde.</hi> That <hi>this revocation of theſe Sentences was not propoſed</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:33452:45"/> 
                  <hi>in any of their avowed meetings, till the general Meetings;</hi> is not ſtrange, for indeed they had no avowed meetings before: Tho' we think their meetings might be avowed before God; but not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his party, who were their cruel Perſecutors. It was done, as is above expreſſed, and confirmed by the General Meeting: And <hi>Ex abundanti,</hi> Ratified by the Aſſembly. Whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that no derogation could be inferred thence, either from the Miniſtry of any who ſat in the Aſſembly, or on the Aſſembly it ſelf, as he malevolently ſuggeſteth. His laſt particular is about the two Commiſſioners, whom the Aſſembly ſent to the King: Where he hath ſome Malign Reflections, both on them who were not ſent, and on them who were ſent. That any were Jealous of Mr. <hi>Carſtairs,</hi> is a baſe Calumny. His Integrity and Skill in the conduct of ſuch Affairs, is known, and valued by all his Brethren who know him. It is as foul a Calumny that <hi>they who were ſent were gratified by it; or had deſigns of their own,</hi> nothing but Malice could ſuggeſt ſuch a thought; For what could they expect: Or what could they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by it? Had they Ambition (one of them being paſt 60.) to ride poſt to <hi>London</hi> in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no higher Poſt in the Church, than they now are in. He will Characterize them alſo: One of them he had before expoſed as far as his Malice and VVit could invent: The other he can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt; and therefore his ſpite prompteth him to reproach his reverend and worthy Father; whoſe praiſe is in the Goſpel, whoſe name is precious in the Church, and is above the ſnarling of ſuch a Curr: Nor one word of what he ſaith in that matter is true: And the contrary is declared by ſome of the Courtiers that attended the King when he went to viſit Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> when he was ſick, and on his Bed. VVhen his Majeſty came into the Room. they who were preſent told, that though they had been long about Court, they never heard a more Handſom Complement, then Mr. <hi>Blair</hi> gave unto the King; nor more becoming a Divine. A Chair was ſet at the Bed ſide, for the King, in which his Majeſty ſat down; after he had talked a little with Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> his Majeſty drew the Chair nearer while he ſat on it; But that ſuch words were ſpoken by Mr. <hi>Blair,</hi> as is alledged, is moſt falſe. I ſhould not have ſtayed ſo much on this, but that the Reader may take notice, what a Spirit of Lying hath poſſeſſed this Phamphleteer; and what ill will he bears to the Living and to the Dead, who have born the name of Presbyterians. He is now at laſt come to the Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Aſſembly: VVhere he would have it thought, that the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:33452:45"/> did deſign to call another without the Kings Commiſſioner, who was ſitting among them, which was never thought nor deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As his Book is full of Lies and Slanders; ſo his Epilogue is an abridgment of them all; doth amaſs them in one; while he ſaith, <hi>That no material Falſhood can be charged upon him:</hi> The Reader will eaſily judge of this aſſertion by what hath been ſaid; of <hi>his Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity</hi> alſo, and of his <hi>hating to tell a Lie.</hi> I leave what hath been ſaid on both ſides to the Candid Judgment of the Impartial Reader, and to his Judgment who is a God of truth, and hateth the Lying Lips; and do joyn with him in his concluding Prayer (as I could do with little that he hath hitherto ſaid,) <hi>That the Lord would pour out his Spirit on us</hi> (and on the other party too,) <hi>That our Land may have peace, that the Diviſions of our Church may be healed, and our Confuſions may be wholly removed, and Order and Government may continue among us.</hi>

Only one of them held her while they ſo dealt with her Husband as aboveſaid.

Yet I judge no Man for his Principle or Motives, but leave that to God and their own Conſciences, tho' this Author Intruding in Gods Throne, is bold to judge of my Heart, and to ſay, <hi>It was Pique, Intereſt and Popularity that moved me.</hi>

                  <p>The Falſhood of his Aſſertions will appear by a true Narrative of the things to which he ſeemeth to relate, which I ſhall give with due Candor and Simplicity, not being afraid humbly to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal not only to the Judgment of all Men who know the things; but to the All-ſeeing God of Truth, to judge betwixt Him and Me in this Matter.</p>
                  <p>I was Ordained Miniſter of the Goſpel in the Honourable City of <hi>Aberdeen, Anno</hi> 1659. by the laying one of the Hands of the Presbytery. And when Prelacy was reintroduced in this Land, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. I was ſtopt in the Exerciſe of my Miniſtry, before the firſt of <hi>October</hi> by that ſame Act of Council, which laid aſide divers Hundreds of worthy Miniſters of this Church, and obliged us to retire twenty Miles diſtant from our own Pariſhes, becauſe we had not received Preſentation from the Patron and Collation from the Biſhop, The condition of which, was the Oath of Canonical Obedience.</p>
                  <p>It's falſe which this Author ſaith (and may be reckoned as the twelfth of his Lies) that Mr. <hi>Meinzies</hi> and I did only heſitate at firſt, upon the Oath of Canonical Obedience, for we never had any heſitation, or doubt upon it, but were clear and poſitive in our Judgment againſt it, and expreſt it as we had occaſion. It's true we did at the firſt offer Submiſſion, and to join in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Synods, thinking this was but the ſame, which worthy men had done before the year 1638. Not diſcerning, as others who ſuffered did, the difference betwixt the State of things, <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. And before the year, 1638.</p>
                  <p>Tho this ſtop in the exerciſe of my Miniſtry, was fourteen days before the Biſhops Synod, yet at that Synod when he did paſs Sentence of Depoſition, againſt Learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Meinzies,</hi> for not Subſcribing the Oath of Canonical Obedience; tho he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Submiſſion: The Biſhop was pleaſed to join me in the Sentence, tho neither preſent nor cited to be preſent. Whether Biſhop <hi>Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel</hi> did Vindicate this his Illegalk and Unjuſt procedure by that lovely Proverb our Author mentioneth, <hi>Fides ſit penes Authorem,</hi> But I was nothing moved with this Sentence.</p>
                  <p>Sometime after this, I retired to the Country twenty eight Miles beyond <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> yet in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> there cometh to me a Summons before the ſecret Council, as was ſaid by the procurement of the Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> alledging he could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the Streets of that City for fear of the People Irritated, as was alledged, by their Paſtors whom they had loſt. At that time
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:33452:48"/> were cited, alſo the famous and worthy, old Mr. <hi>Cant,</hi> and his Son Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Meinzies.</hi> The good old man got a Teſtificat that he was not able to Travel. The reſt of us went South with no leſs hazard than our Lives, it beign a grievous Storm and Tempeſt. Mr. <hi>Alexander Cant</hi> falling unwell compeared not. When Mr. <hi>Meinzes</hi> and I compeared, the Earl of <hi>Midletoun</hi> then Lord Commiſſioner, and the Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and others of the Council, finding that there was nothing to lay to our charge, and hearing from us, that we were willing to join in Presbyteries and Synods, did by Act of ſecret Council recommend us to the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> to be reſtored to our places.</p>
                  <p>When this was preſented to the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> he readily promiſed to obey it, but never ſpoke to us one word of the Oath of Canonical Obedience. Yea I would ask any judicious Perſon, if it was probable that (knowing our peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Reſolutions againſt it) either the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> would have inſiſted to require, or we conſented to Subſcribe that Oath, when we had an Act of Council in our Favours, and at the ſame time they had publiſhed a Treatiſe, entituled, a <hi>Plea for Submiſſion to the preſent Government,</hi> wherein they made offer of diverſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions to them who would ſubmit. But the Biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> being then ready to go from <hi>Edinburgh</hi> to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> deſired us in our return for <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> to call for his Letter, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhould be ready for us. But neither when we came to St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> did he ſpeak to us of Subſcribing the Oath of Canonical Obedience, nor did we ſubſcribe any Paper to him, nor ſtay with him one quarter of an hour, it being late, and he ſtudying his Chriſtmaſs Sermon, and we to go over the Ferry. Nor did his Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> bear any thing of our Subſcribing that Oath, neither would I have been the bearer of ſo mauifeſt an untruth. Yea when in his Letter he had written, that we were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to own the Government, I refuſed to receive it, unleſs he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Qualification (<hi>ſo far as to join in Presbyteries and Synods</hi>) to which he agreed, when we would take it on no other terms.</p>
                  <p>Neither did Biſhop <hi>Mitchel</hi> after our Return, inſiſt any more on our Subſcribing the Oath of Canonical Obedience; but having cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together ſome Miniſters, there was a paper drawn out of the words of the above-mentioned Letter, which Paper indeed we did Subſcribe, and I hear ſome of that Party, whether out of Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or ill will at me, have ſearched for it among Biſhop <hi>Mitchel</hi>'s Papers. But I value not what uſe they make of it. That Paper
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33452:48"/> the Biſhop ordered Doctor <hi>Keith</hi> to read publickly in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> Thinking thereby to leſſen our eſteem among the People, but that deſign failed, none of us were preſent at the reading of it. But the next Lords day when I appeared firſt to Preach, I told publickly (Mr. <hi>J. P.</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Roſs,</hi> being preſent) that I conceived that I had yielded to nothing, but what I firſt offered.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing this Author is not only injurious to me, but to learned and Pious Mr. <hi>Meinzies;</hi> whoſe memory is precious to me, beſide all that I have ſaid for his Honour, I add that not only the Teſt, but the Subſcribing of this Paper, was grievous to that good man before his death, and although I was then at South, I had it afterward, from a worthy Perſon and Friend of his who had it from himſelf. And I can ſay of my ſelf, I did lament becauſe of it ſeveral years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that, and altho this Author deſign me no favour, yet as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we are more obliged to our Enemies, than to our friends ſo here he giveth me opportunity to tell the World, that I repent for the Subſcribing of that Paper. Altho I never Subſcribed the Oath of Canonical Obedience. But being then young and paying too much deference and reſpect to a friend who drew it; I did the leſs ſeriouſly conſider either the Words or matter of it.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I afterwards was in Friendſhip with Biſhop <hi>Scougal</hi> who was a Learned and moderate Man, I did alſo ſit in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Synods, thinking my ſelf free to join in theſe Duties to which I was Authorized by my office, altho there had been no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in the World, nor do I think that by this I payed formal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Obedience, ſo that the aſſerting of this, may be reputed a thirteenth of this Authors lies Yet if he or any elſe can ſhew me wherein I have complied contrary to my Principles, or to the juſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of others, which I have not confeſſed already, I am ready to acknowledge it was my fault, but this I can ſay, the Biſhops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did not judge me a favourer of Prelacy, and my intimates knew me to be Presbyterian in my Principles, and I did never wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly deſert theſe Principles. For it's a manifeſt untruth which this Author aſſerts, that I ſwore and ſubſcribed the Declaration when I was admitted Rector, in the <hi>Mareſchall</hi> Colledge in <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> I neither took it then, nor at any other time, anent which I appeal to all records. Nor indeed was it required of me, nor did the Act mention Rectors.</p>
                  <p>It was not the leaſt Cauſe of my refuſing the Teſt, that I was obliged thereby to declare, that there lay no Obligation on me, to endeavour any Alteration in the Government of the Church. For I
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33452:49"/> profeſs I did judge it Duty in my Station, and according to my power, did endeavour to promote the Alteration, and the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Prelacy. And do not deny, I did Bleſs God, and Call the people of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> to Bleſs him for the removal of it, and pray that it may never return. But that ever I uſed Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs or Severity againſt any of that party, this Author cannot prove: And all who know me, do know theſe are things which I abhor, and my deſire is to promote Meekneſs and Charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men:</p>
                  <p>Theſe alſo, who were of the Prelatical way, and Intimately acquainted with me, know the Falſhood of what he ſays of my breaking off all Correſpondence with them in any thing which Civility and Friendſhip obligeth me unto. Yea, I am confident not only they, but all of that way, who know me, will allow me this Teſtimony that whenever they deſired, yea, on all occaſions according to my p[ower, I was ready to do them Acts of Kindneſs. And when I was laſt in <hi>Aberdeen,</hi> the preſent Incumbents of that place and I did Friendly Viſit one another. It's true one of them being occaſionally in a Neighbours Houſe, came to me as I lighted from my Horſe, and deſired me to preach for him the next Lords day (but neither he nor any elſe did it afterwards:) And I hope he will not ſay, but I gave him a Civil, and as I conceive an Anſwer which might have ſatisfied him.</p>
                  <p>As for what this Author ſaith, That it was <hi>Pique</hi> which mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Me to ſtrike in with the Presbyterians, becauſe I was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to the Exerciſe of my Miniſtry at <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> This is a preſumptuous aſcending Gods Throne, to judge my Heart, and Motives. As alſo what he ſaith afterward. That <hi>Pique, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Popularity,</hi> were my Temptation: I can comfortably ſay, He that knoweth all Things, knoweth this is falſe. It was Conſcience, and not ſuch baſe Motives that moved Me: And I think I may obtain Teſtimony from theſe who know me both in the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Weſt,</hi> that they have other Thoughts of me than that I am led by ſuch baſe Motives. It's true the Town of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deen,</hi> to whoſe kindneſs I always was, and am on all occaſions, much obliged, when they conceived any hopes of obtaining my regreſs to them without any Obligation or Oath, did move for it. But neither this Author, nor any elſe can prove that I did deſire it, or made any Applicatiom to the Biſhops for it. How far ſome of the Biſhops complied with a great perſon of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh perſwaſion, to obſtruct that deſign (tho it was known that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:33452:49"/> it was difference of Religion that engaged him againſt it) the Town of <hi>Aberdeen</hi> know in part, and I leave it to the Biſhops own Conſciences to judge. For ingenuouſly profeſs I never had any Pique at them on that account, nor was it Pique, but Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which moved me; to joyn with the Presbyterians, for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch in my judgment, and about a year after the time, he ſpeaks of, by an unexpected Providence, receiving an Unanimous Call, from a Noble Perſon (who alſo was Patron of the Pariſh) and other Heretors and Body of the people of the Pariſh of <hi>Kilwinning,</hi> an united Pariſh, which for divers years had been vacant; I did by the Approbation of the Presbytery of <hi>Irwin,</hi> come and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour among them in the Work of the Goſpel. Yet there is more than one falſhood inſinuated by this Author, in that which he ſaith in the beginning of this Paragraph, concerning Me, that ever ſince King <hi>James</hi>'s Indulgence I did Preach in a Meeting-houſe, for it was a year after that Liberty was given, that I entered here, and for theſe two years without the Reluctancy of any, have Preached in the Church. It is true in the year 1688. the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation Aſſembled in another Houſe than the Church, the Law not allowing us the ſame; tho' all that time it was empty, except that Mr. <hi>Bell,</hi> being after my coming here preſented by the Biſhop, came and Preached to his opwn Servant, and two or three more (who were ſollicited to hear him) at two ſeveral times in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and went off in the Afternoon; and having for that obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed half a years Stipend, was preſented to another Church, where he had little better Reception.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo falſe which he ſaith, in the end of this Paragraph, that at firſt, I pretended that I would only attempt to reclaim the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded people of the Weſt, from their Errours and Extravagancies. Perhaps he deſigneth by this, to breed in the people a diſlike of me. But I hope they will not believe him. And it is moſt falſe that ever I expreſt my ſelf ſo concerning the people of the Weſt, or my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in going among them. My deſign was to Preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to advance Truth and Holineſs, and Peace and Love among Men. I acknowledge, if a Miniſter find any Errours, or Extravagancies among a people, his endeavour ſhould be to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, but I bleſs God this Author cannot juſtly charge this Congregation with theſe things.</p>
                  <p>As for what he ſaith, was foretold by a Perſon of Quality, and great Worth; I neither know of whom he meaneth, nor yet the prediction, and perhaps this is of the ſame kind, with the reſt of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:33452:50"/> our Authors Aſſertions. Sure I am diverſe Perſons of Quality and Worth, to whom I did ſhew my Call, did approve my Acceptance of it, tho' in their Affection, they regrated my going from the North.</p>
                  <p>In fine, tho' this Author hath ſaid that it could not be denied that I carried my ſelf well, and gained the good Opinion of all, while I kept my place at <hi>Aberdeen;</hi> and inſtanceth me as a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon, tho' under Temptation: Yet he is ſo diſcreet in the end, as to repreſent both this people and me as enſnared in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Fooleries; but I forgive him. It is a ſmall thing for me to be judged of Men; better than I have been rated as Fools. But in love to his Soul I commend to his Meditation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15.</p>
                  <p>I am really weary in inſiſting ſo long on things relating to my Perſon. I do acknowledge the World would be at no great loſs tho' I were buried in the Duſt, and my Name in Oblivion, and were it not for my reſpect to the publick Intereſt, which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor endeavoureth to hurt by expoſing me, I ſhould not have troubled my ſelf, and the Reader with this Vindication, being hopeful that his defaming of me cannot hinder my acceptance, nor the ſucceſs of my Labours, where I am known.</p>
                  <p>I hear, there are ſome other things, in that Pamphlet, which relate to me, but my Friend gave me no tranſcript of them, nor have I ſeen the Book, and I am told they are of no great Moment, and but By-blows to me, while he is reflecting on other Perſons and Things, and perhaps you may ſufficiently Vindicate them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my help.</p>
                  <p>I am told he acknowledgeth I preached a Sermon for Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but added ſuch Cautions as made all ineffectual. To which I ſhall only ſay, I know none that deny, but there is need of Caution, leſt Men under the Name of Moderation degenerate to Lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and excluding of Zeal; but I know no Caution I gave which had not a Scripture warrant. And if this Author had heard it, I think he hath good will enough to repreſent it, could he catch at any ſhadow of ground for it.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo told, he reflects on me about a Paper ſaid to be given in to the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> wherein it ſhould have been ſaid the Goſpel had not been preached in <hi>Aberdeen</hi> theſe 30 years, but not having ſeen the Book, nor any Tranſcript of that matter I can give no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Anſwer. But as it's related to me, it ſeemeth of a Piece with the reſt of his Aſſertions; only to ſatisfie any ſober perſon, who may be ſtumbled at ſuch an Expreſſion, I do publickly profeſs, I am ſo
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33452:50"/> far from thinking ſo, or approving any who ſhould think or ſpeak it, that I Aſſert and Declare, I have in that time often heard, to my great Comfort and Edification, the Goſpel both plainly and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preached at <hi>Aberdeen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I fear I have wearied you, and ſhall only add that I ſhall not ceaſe to pray the Lord would preſerve you long to do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in his Church, and ſhall continue,</p>
